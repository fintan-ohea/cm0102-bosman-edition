"""League sizes of the original that become run-time values (0.6.0 slice 18).

Each league class of one division sets its club count in create_table with one store,
`mov word ptr [reg + 0x3e], imm` (League::check_complete 0x689b3d reads +0x3e), and then takes the clubs whose
division (club +0x57) is its key id, in the order of the club table, up to that count (EngConf::create_table
0x56ecb0 at 0x56ed54..0x56ed7f; with fewer the table is not made, 0x56ed95..0x56edab). The runtime replaces
the immediate with rt_league_clubs(object, immediate) (src/recomp_rt/win/season_sizes.c): the original's
count in the base game, the count of the season in a season game.

CLASSES: one row per class: (class, source file, set_up_rules address, [create_table store addresses]).
The stores come from the translated code of each create_table (one store, or one per path where the class has
a year branch: FraFirst 0x5bc2bd, PolSecond 0x7cbdfd, ScoPrm 0x7f2820, NorFirst 0x7909a0). A class with no
store takes the count of the data (IreFirst 0x63591f, IrePrm 0x63a74f, PolFirst 0x7c9469 store a register), so
it has only its set_up_rules row. set_up_rules (vtable +0x8c) writes the promotion and relegation places
+0xbe..+0xc1; the runtime wraps it (season_size_wraps.c, made by tools/seasons/make_size_wraps.py) and sets the
places of the season after it. Evidence: docs/research/2026-10-18-league-sizes.md.

The group classes (BelThird, FraLower, SpaLower, SpaSecondB, PorSecondB, SweSecond, TurSecondB, ItaSerC2a..c,
BraNatThird, GerRegional), ArgSecond (25 clubs with a fix-up of the 25th at 0x407dc0 and zones that read
fixed rows, 0x4082fd and 0x4083d5: a 2010/11 start with 20 stopped at arg_second.cpp 85), DenSecond (one division of 16, while the real 2nd Divisions
are groups from 2005/06 with rows of 28 to 32 clubs and the places of the groups), FinFirst (the North and South groups are two objects of one class, 0x593a82, while
the table holds one division from 2002) and UsaMls (three groups of 4, season_mls.c) are not here: their sizes are groups.
