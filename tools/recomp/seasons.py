"""Year constants of the original that become run-time values, for a game that starts in another season.

The original starts every game in 2001/02 and writes 2001, 2002 and 2003 as constants in some instructions.
Each entry of PATCHES names the address of one instruction, the constant it holds and the C expression that
replaces it. rt_season_year is the start year of the game (src/recomp_rt/win/season.c): 2001 in the base game,
so every replaced instruction gives the original's result there. INSNS replaces a whole instruction, as in
widescreen.py. The evidence for each address is in docs/research/2026-10-17-first-season-branches.md
(0.6.0 slice 11).
