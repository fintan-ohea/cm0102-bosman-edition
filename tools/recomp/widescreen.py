"""Screen size constants of the original that become run-time values, for widescreen mode.

The original draws at 800x600 and writes the size as constants in some instructions. Each entry names
the address of one instruction, the constant it holds and the C expression that replaces it. The runtime
sets rt_screen_w and rt_screen_h (rt.c: 800x600 by default, main.c: from the settings file).

Only constants that do not go into the area or widget create functions are here: the runtime scales
those coordinates when it creates the area or widget (src/recomp_rt/win/display.c). The evidence for
each address is in docs/research/2026-10-14-widescreen-inventory.md.
