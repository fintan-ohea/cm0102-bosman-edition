"""Functions of the original that the runtime calls by address with rt_callback.

RT_WRAP and RT_REPLACE stop the build when their function is missing. A plain rt_callback call has no
such check, so a wrong address would only fail at run time. This list closes the gap in two ways:

- Each address below must be a translated function that starts with the bytes written here (its first
  eight bytes in cm0102.exe 3.9.68).
- Each address of code that a file in CALLBACK_FILES writes in C code (not in a comment) must be in this
  list. So a new call needs a line here, with the bytes from the original.
