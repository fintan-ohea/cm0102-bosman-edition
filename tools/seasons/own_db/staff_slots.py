"""Fill empty non-playing staff slots with the database's own free staff, so that a new game with every league
selected fits the original game's 23,000 extra staff rows.

usage: python3 -I staff_slots.py <db folder> <report.tsv> [<target need>]

At a new game, database_generate_extra_non_playing_staff 0x527240 makes a stand-in coach, scout, physio or manager
for every empty slot of the clubs of the selected nations, from 23,000 reserve rows (0x528540). With every league
selected, the game stops at "Database.cpp 1844" (0x527e4c) when it needs more. The 3.9.68 data needs 22,645 by the
estimate of src/recomp_rt/win/staff_reserve.c (need() below counts the same way); the Update Team templates need
23,832 (November 2007) and 23,061 (September 2005), and our databases more (long test of 2026-10-21). Max's answer
(option A): fill empty slots at the lowest-reputation clubs of each nation with that nation's own free non-playing
staff until the need is under the target (22,000 by default, so the 22,500 of the answer holds with margin).

Who: a free non-player (staff +0x5f 1, no club +0x39, no national team +0x24, a non-player row +0x69) whose job
+0x3d is the slot's (8 coach, 9 scout, 10 physio, 5 manager), of the club's nation (+0x1a against club +0x53),
aged 26 to 70 in the game's first season. Nobody with a club moves. Which: the slots go from the lowest club
reputation (+0x80) up, and each takes the free person of its nation and job whose ability (non-player +0x04)
is nearest the median ability of the employed staff of that job at clubs of that reputation (500 a step).
What changes: the person's club, a joined date of 1 July of the first season, a contract to 30 June two years on,
and the contract fields +0x4e..+0x5e of the employed staff member of that job and nation at the nearest club
reputation; the club's slot list (+0xcf manager, +0x19f coaches, +0x1b3 scouts, +0x1cf physios).
