# Own season databases

These tools build the 2004/05 and 2006/07 season databases (Q351). The facts come from Football Manager 2005 and
2007: names, dates of birth, nations, clubs, jobs, contracts, loans (2004/05), careers, final tables and
competition winners. The ratings and positions come from the Update Team databases. Key players with no Update
Team record (Q383) are the one exception: FM's rating of each is the reference for his ratings (Max, 2026-10-17),
through a mapping that `keyplayers.py` derives from the matched players and prints at each run.

The Football Manager discs are untrusted data. Mount an image read-only. Read it only with `python3 -I`. Run
nothing from it. Keep the disc files, the facts and the work folders outside the repo. Commit no Football Manager
data and nothing made from it.

## Paths

| Placeholder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `<DB>` | the folder of Update Team databases (`test-fixtures/databases`) |
| `<FM2005 db>` | `data/db` of the FM2005 disc, copied as data |
| `<setup.jar>` | `setup.jar` of the mounted FM2007 disc |
| `<db700>` | a new folder for the FM2007 database files |
| `<facts>` | a new folder for the facts pickles |
| `<work>` | a new folder for the match and league pickles |
| `<conv>` | the converter's output folder (it must not exist) |
| `<out>` | the new database folder (it must not exist) |

Run each command from `tools/seasons/own_db`.

## 2004/05 (Summer 2004)

```bash
python3 -I fm2005/read_fm2005.py "<FM2005 db>" "<facts>"
python3 -I match.py 2004 "<DB>/September 2005" "<facts>" "<work>"
python3 -I leagues.py 2004 "<DB>/September 2005" "<facts>" "<work>"
python3 -I convert.py 2004 "<DB>/September 2005" "<facts>" "<work>" "<DB>/September 2010 ODB" "<conv>" "<DB>/October 2003"
python3 -I keyplayers.py 2004 "<conv>" "<facts>" "<work>" "<DB>" "<out>" [<overrides.tsv>]
python3 -I duplicates.py merge "<out>" "<DB>/September 2005" "<conv>" "<work>/duplicates.tsv"
python3 -I staff_slots.py "<out>" "<work>/staff-slots.tsv"
python3 -I duplicates.py check "<out>"
```

## 2006/07 (Summer 2006)

Mount the FM2007 image read-only first, for example `hdiutil attach -readonly -nobrowse <image>` on macOS.

```bash
python3 -I fm2007/unpack_setup_jar.py "<setup.jar>" "<db700>"
python3 -I fm2007/read_fm2007.py "<db700>" "<facts>"
python3 -I match.py 2006 "<DB>/November 2007" "<facts>" "<work>"
python3 -I leagues.py 2006 "<DB>/November 2007" "<facts>" "<work>"
python3 -I convert.py 2006 "<DB>/November 2007" "<facts>" "<work>" "<DB>/September 2010 ODB" "<conv>" "<DB>/September 2005"
python3 -I keyplayers.py 2006 "<conv>" "<facts>" "<work>" "<DB>" "<out>" [<overrides.tsv>]
python3 -I duplicates.py merge "<out>" "<DB>/November 2007" "<conv>" "<work>/duplicates.tsv"
python3 -I staff_slots.py "<out>" "<work>/staff-slots.tsv"
python3 -I duplicates.py check "<out>"
```

`duplicates.py merge` makes one row of each person who has two (a fill row or a key player's row beside the
template's row, or a template that has a person twice; the rules are in its header), and `check` fails while one
is left. The release zips run the check too.

`staff_slots.py` gives empty coach, scout, physio and manager slots at the lowest-reputation clubs of each nation
to that nation's free non-playing staff, until a new game with every league selected needs fewer than 22,000 of
the original game's 23,000 extra staff rows (else it stops at "Database.cpp 1844"; the header has the rules).

`<conv>` is a new folder for the converter's output. The overrides file (identity decisions per key player, see
`keyplayers.py`) names FM rows, so it stays in the work folder with the FM data. Two builds with different
`PYTHONHASHSEED` values (run with `python3 -P -s`, because `-I` ignores the seed) give the same files.

## Mapping of FM ratings (key players only)

`keyplayers.py` maps each FM value to the median Update Team value of the matched players with the same FM value
(`value_map`), made non-decreasing. Above and below the values that at least 100 matched players have, the map goes
on with slope 1 from the last such value. Potential ability and each attribute have their own map in the same
way. FM's position ratings go across as they are. Attributes map byte by byte: `CM_ATTRS` in `keyplayers.py`
gives the FM attribute of each CM 01/02 attribute byte. The tool prints the maps to its log; keep the log with the
FM data, outside the repo.

## After a rebuild

1. Print the club table rows with `python3 -I club_rows.py <year> "<template>" "<work>"`. `--write` puts them into the part files and replaces the rows of that season with the same labels.
2. Put the new sizes and SHA-256 of `index.dat`, `club.dat` and `staff.dat` in `docs/research/rules-0.6.0/databases-signatures.tsv`.
3. Measure the date shifts with `python3 -I ../measure_date_shifts.py <3.9.68 Data> <folder with the new database> --only "Summer 2006"`, or "Summer 2004". Copy the printed row into `databases-date-shifts.tsv`. Set careers_kept and last_rows to 0.
4. Make the C tables with `python3 -I ../make_db_table.py` and `python3 -I ../make_dates_table.py`.
5. Zip the database folder under its name (for example `Summer 2006/`) into the own databases folder that `make_release.sh --own-dbs` takes.
6. Run `ctest -R "seasons_table|season_dates_table"` and `tests/seasons/season_dates_run.py --only <year>`.

The settings of each season are in `season_2004.py` and `season_2006.py`. Each file gives the template, the real
lists with one source each, the play-off winners and the part file of each list.

## Club tables of Spain, Germany, Scotland, Austria and Switzerland

`club_rows.py` writes these lists with the labels below. `make_clubs.py` (slice 15 branch) maps a label to a
database division only through its TARGETS list, so slice 15 adds these lines to TARGETS:

```python
    ("aut-sui", r"Austrian Bundesliga", "Austrian Premier Division"),
    ("aut-sui", r"Swiss Super League", "Swiss National Division A"),
    ("ger", r"Bundesliga", "German First Division"),
    ("ger", r"2\. Bundesliga", "German Second Division"),
    ("sco", r"Scottish Premier League", "Scottish Premier Division"),
    ("sco", r"Scottish (First|Second|Third) Division", "="),
    ("spa", r"La Liga", "Spanish First Division"),
    ("spa", r"Segunda División", "Spanish Second Division"),
```

Switzerland has 12 places in the game and 10 real clubs in 2004/05 and 2006/07.

## Long holiday test (original start)

```bash
python3 tools/seasons/own_db/long_test.py build/cm0102_recomp <game folder> <out folder> [england-germany|all]
```

The game folder is a 3.9.68 game with the season database in its Data folder, as a player installs it. The test
plays from July 2001 to 1 September 2004 on holiday, saves on each 1 July and on 1 September, loads each save in
the next step, and checks the squads of Real Madrid, Bayern and Arsenal in each save (`save_check.py`). It passes
with no error box, every save written and loaded, and every squad check passed (header of `long_test.py`).
