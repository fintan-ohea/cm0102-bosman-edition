"""The long holiday test of a season database in the original game's start (forum release, 2026-10-22).

usage: python3 tools/seasons/own_db/long_test.py <program> <game folder> <out folder> [england-germany|all]

The game folder is a 3.9.68 game with the season database copied into its Data folder, as a player installs it.
The program is the built cm0102_recomp. The run uses the original start (RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off, July 2001):
1. a new game with England and Germany (or Select All), Arsenal, then a holiday to 1 July 2002 and a save;
2. to 4. the save is loaded and the holiday goes on to 1 July 2003, 1 July 2004 and 1 September 2004, with a save
   at each date (three season changes, the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004 and their qualifiers);
5. the last save is loaded and played one more day.
Each save of steps 1 to 4 goes through save_check.py (Real Madrid, Bayern and Arsenal squads). A step starts only
while the 1-minute load is below 24 and fewer than 15 games run (no other limit of the machine is read).

Pass: no error box in any step, every save written and loaded, every squad check passed. The run prints one line
a step and PASS or FAILED, and keeps each step's stderr.txt in the out folder. It takes about 40 minutes with
England and Germany and about 5 hours with every league.
