# How the Bosman Edition is tested

This page explains how we test CM 01/02: Bosman Edition before each release. For each test it gives what it checks, when it runs, the pass rule and the script.

Each test runs at one or more of these points:

- each change, while a feature or fix is built
- each merge, when finished work joins the main branch
- each release, before Max decides to publish

## Code tests

Small test programs check single parts of the code, such as the options file, the season rules tables, the cup draws and the heap. They run with `ctest` in the `build/` folder.

They run at each change and at each merge. The pass rule is that every test passes.

## Same-save checks

The original game picks its results partly from where its data sits in memory. A new screen or option can move that data and so change later matches, even when the player makes the same clicks. Our rule is that a feature must not change the game, except for the team that the player picks.

A same-save check plays the same clicks twice, once with the option on and once with it off. Then it compares the two saves. It also plays one run again to show that the result repeats. The checks start from a saved game at the start of a season, from a saved game before a match, and from a new game.

The script is `tests/smoke/smoke_run.py --same-save`, with `--match` for the match check. `tests/smoke/same_save_views.py` checks the screens.

The checks run before each merge of game code and again on the merged build. The pass rule is equal saves. Five files can differ only when the option opens a screen that the off run does not open, because that moves memory. We record each such case and tell Max. Any other difference stops the merge until we find the cause.

## Start-season soaks

For each start season from 2001/02 to 2025/26, a soak plays a new game with all nations loaded and the changing rules on. The manager goes on holiday and the quick result engine plays the matches.

Each soak goes on until the game completes at least one World Cup and one European Championship, with their qualifiers and every season change between them. It stops at about 1 September after the later tournament. A 2001 start runs to September 2004, and a 2016 start runs to September 2021 because Euro 2020 was played in 2021.

Near each 1 July the game saves. A new copy of the program loads that save and plays on.

The scripts are `tests/seasons/soak_run.py` and `tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py`. The soaks run at each release on the final main branch. A fix that touches a season change gets the same run to the same end point. The pass rule is no error box, no stall and a save and load that work at each July.

## Full play

Full play uses the match engine, as a player sees it. It runs five starts across the eras: 2002, 2006, 2013, 2021 and 2025, with all nations. Each goes to the same end point as the soaks, with the same save and load near each 1 July.

The script is `tests/seasons/full_play_run.py`. It runs at each release. The pass rule is the same as for the soaks.

## Long games

Long games run from 2001/02 to 2027/28 with all nations and different random seeds, to find faults that build up over many seasons. They use `tests/seasons/soak_run.py` with `--last 2027`. They run when the machine has free time, and they do not hold back a release. A fault that they find is fixed in the same way as any other.

## Memory and big saves

A game with all nations uses more memory each season. The heap now has room for about 2 GB of game data. A code test (`tests/recomp/test_heap.c`) fills a small heap and checks that it still serves new blocks.

Saves can now be up to 4 GB. A save that would be larger stops with a clear message and keeps the earlier save. `tests/smoke/big_save_run.py` makes a save above 3 GB and loads it again, checks a season part above 2 GB, and checks the clean stop above 4 GB. It needs about 12 GB of free disk for a short time. These checks run at the merge of a memory or save change and in the long games at each release.

## Screen sweeps and smoke screenshots

The screen sweep opens the tables, results, fixtures, schedule and history of every competition, once each season. The data sweep reads each competition from memory at the start and end of each season. It looks for dates outside the season and for empty tables where the rules give clubs. The scripts are `tests/seasons/screen_sweep_run.py` and `tests/seasons/data_sweep_run.py`. They run at each release.

The smoke test plays a fixed set of clicks through the main screens in the classic and widescreen modes. It compares each screenshot with a reference picture. The script is `tests/smoke/smoke_run.py --mode classic` or `--mode widescreen`. It runs at each merge and at each release. The pass rule is no error box and pictures that match. When a change draws something new on purpose, we look at the picture and record a new reference.

## Platform checks

The game ships for Mac, Windows and Linux. At each release the release script builds all three packages. The Windows build runs its smoke test under wine on the Mac. The Linux build is made and checked in a linux/amd64 container. Each platform runs the smoke test in both screen modes and a season change with a save and load.

## Rules source checks

The season rules come from a table with one row per competition and season. `tools/research/rules_lint.py` checks that every filled fact has a source. `tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py` compares the competitions that the game holds each season with that table. Both run at each change to the rules and at each release. The pass rule is no missing source and no difference.

## Database checks

The duplicate check, `tests/seasons/history_duplicates_check.py`, lists the history rows that a season database holds twice. The game clears the extra copies when it loads the database. `tests/seasons/season_history_run.py --duplicates` checks that no copy is left in the game.

Our own season databases have two more checks. `tools/seasons/own_db/duplicates.py check <database>` fails while any player is listed twice (same nation, matching names and birth dates, or the same full name at one club). `tools/seasons/own_db/long_test.py` plays a holiday from July 2001 to 1 September 2004 on the database, with a save each 1 July that the next step loads. `tools/seasons/own_db/save_check.py` then checks each save: big clubs keep full squads, and no player or name appears twice. The pass rule is no error box and every check passes.

We also check nation names in every database, such as Yugoslavia, the Netherlands Antilles and Kosovo. Draws and qualifying pools must pick only nations that exist in that season.

## After-load sweeps

Many faults show only after a saved game loads. An after-load sweep reads each season module for data that the save does not keep, or that a load does not rebuild or clear. Each suspect place gets a test that saves before the risky moment, loads, and plays on. These sweeps run at each release that adds season code. The July save and load in the soaks and full play repeat this check on every run.

## Reviews

A fresh reviewer reads each change before it merges. A small fix gets one fresh review. A new slice of work gets two. Each problem found is fixed before the merge.

## The rules we keep

### Every failure is fixed

Every failure that any test finds is fixed before the release (decision O151). Each fix needs a passing retest and a same-save check. We do not ship a known issue or move a failure to a later version.

### Run length

Every holiday or soak run, and every retest of a fix that touches a season change, goes on to the end point above (decision O166).

### Machine limits

The tests run many games at once on one machine, so we keep these limits:

- at most 16 test games run at one time
- no new game starts while the machine load is 24 or more
- builds go through a queue, with at most three at once

A test that fails only under heavy load runs again alone before we treat it as a fault.

### Release approval

When every test passes, we write a test report for the release. Max reads it and approves every release himself.
