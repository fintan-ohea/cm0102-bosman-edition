/* The heap inside the flat memory, from RT_HEAP_BASE up.
 *
 * Two modes:
 * - bump (rt_heap_bump = 1): never reuses memory and rounds each block to 16 bytes. The database load
 *   test (tests/recomp) uses it, so that the addresses match the Unicorn run byte for byte.
 * - free list (the default): each block has a 16-byte header before it with the asked size and the
 *   room. Small blocks (up to SMALL_MAX bytes of room) go back to a list per room size. Large blocks go
 *   back to a list sorted by address and join their free neighbours.
 *
 * The limit of the arena (0.6.0 release test). A Select All game from 2001 had 163 MB in use and its top at 380 MB
 * after one season, and reached the end of the arena of 0.5.0 (RT_HEAP_SIZE, 1024 MB) in its ninth season ("heap
 * full"). Two causes: freed small blocks stay in the list of their own room and never join, and an array of the game
 * grows by 6400 bytes at each realloc, about 843 times a season, so each old copy stays as a hole just too small for
 * the next one. So:
 * - The arena is RT_HEAP_ARENA (2032 MB, to 0xEF000000). Small blocks stop one eighth before its end, and that last
 *   eighth is kept for large blocks.
 * - When the top would pass the end, the free small blocks join the large spans (sorted by address, neighbours joined;
 *   again at each later time the arena is full). From then on a small block whose list is empty is cut from one of
 *   those spans, and a large block that grows by realloc gets half its size again as room, so that it grows in place.
 * Up to the end for small blocks (far past 1024 MB) nothing differs, so every address of a game that 0.5.0's arena
 * could hold stays the same (Q152). RECOMP_HEAP_ARENA_MB (a test switch) makes the arena smaller, so a test game
 * reaches the end early. */
