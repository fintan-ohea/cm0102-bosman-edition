 * A cup class of the original makes its round table at every season start (set_up_rounds, vtable +0x8c, which
 * calls create_round_table) and at a new game. A round is 0x68 bytes. Five of its fields say how the round is
 * played: the match flags of the first match (+0x0d), the flags of the deciding match (+0x0f, the replay or the
 * second leg), the replays allowed (+0x20), the legs (+0x21) and the days to the replay or second leg (+0x22).
 * The table cup_formats.tsv gives one word for each round (the types below). This file holds the part that does
 * not touch the game's memory, so a test on the host can run it. season_kind_cups.c is the rule kind. */
