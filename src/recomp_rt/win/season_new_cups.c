/* New domestic cups (0.6.0 slice 21c, docs/research/2026-10-18-cups-more.md, section 3): the Turkish, Russian and
 * Norwegian Super Cups, the Russian Premier League Cup, the Conference League Cup and the All-Ireland cup, made by the
 * new competitions module (season_comps.h) with the formats of season_cups_more.c (season_cups.h).
 *
 * Each cup is an object of the class ItaSuper (constructor 0x65f670, thiscall (year, record) ret 8, size 0xb2 as
 * create_italian_comps 0x835320 allocates it; vtable 0x96c8b8, 40 slots as the Cup classes, sweep-europe 2.2), a Cup of
 * the original with one round table and one team list. The module makes it in the entry hook of the first season that
 * the format plays; this file gives it its own vtable copy (season_comps_def_vtable), so the season change, the
 * rules report and the wraps of season_super_cups.c know it by its file. The constructor calls the team picker
 * (init_team_list 0x65fa60) and create_round_table (0x65f920): their wraps (season_super_cups.c) call
 * season_new_cups_teams and season_new_cups_rounds below, which give the clubs of the cup's nation and its rounds.
 * The ruling body (+0x50, the byte that ItaSuper sets to Italy's 0x11 at 0x65f6c0) is that of the other objects of
 * the entry. A save keeps the object in its file (the module makes it again at a load, season_comps.h).
 *
 * A season with no edition: the before hook of start_new_season (kind "new_cups") skips the cup (season_change_skip)
 * and, when the format plays again, sets +0x40 to S - 1, so start_new_season (0x65fc90, inc word [esi+0x40]) builds
 * edition S with dates in the future (the third case of season_comps.h: a Cup that makes its fixtures at each draw).
 * An edition whose first match lies before the game date when the module wants to make it (a calendar-year cup at a
 * new game in July) is not made: the module asks again in the next season. */

 * Discipline::restore_held_bans 0x556570 drops them by the same test (cmp at 0x55671c, je 0x55671e). So a player of
 * an Irish club on loan at a Northern Irish club had his Irish bans held, met the Irish body in the cup, and the
 * body found the held ban (the box ruling_body..cpp 661, 0x7e833c). While the cup is in the game, the two nations
 * count as one for these tests: the bans of the cup's body stay with the player in both. The base game has no such
 * cup, so its tests are the original's. */
