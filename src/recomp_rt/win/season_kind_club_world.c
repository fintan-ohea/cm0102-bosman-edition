/* Rule kind "club_world" of the season change (0.6.0 slice 26, part a; season_change.h): the club competitions
 * of the original outside UEFA play an edition only in the seasons that the rules table holds them
 * (docs/research/rules-0.6.0/club-world.tsv). Examples: the Intercontinental Cup to 2004/05 only, the FIFA Club
 * World Championship every year from 2005/06 and not after 2024/25, the Copa Mercosur and the Merconorte Cup
 * in 2001/02 only, the Inter-American Cup never, the Oceania Champions Cup from 2004/05 except 2020/21.
 *
 * Evidence: docs/research/2026-10-18-club-world-idle.md. The method is the state that the original itself uses
 * between two editions of the Club World Championship: the object stays (other code reads it with no null
 * test: the Libertadores writes its winner into the Intercontinental Cup at 0x4c41a0..0x4c41d0, the FA Cup
 * walks the entry 2 array at 0x56fb08), and its season year +0x40 is the year of its next edition. The dates
 * of that edition lie in the future, so the object makes no fixtures (no constructor makes fixtures; a League
 * class draws on its start date, a Cup class on its draw date) and is not complete, so the season pass does
 * not start it again (all_stages_complete 0x48ce10, the pass at 0x5d5ccb). An edition of year Y plays in game
 * season Y for every class here (doc section 6).
 *
 * The two paths (build brief, "Common to slices 15b to 29"):
 *   - a new game of a season game (start year not 2001, or changing rules on): the wraps of the constructors
 *     below give the constructor the year of the first edition from the start season on (thiscall, ret 8:
 *     the year, then the record). The constructor builds every date from that year (doc section 1, point 2).
 *   - with changing rules on, at each season change: the before hook of start_new_season sets +0x40 to the
 *     year of the next edition minus the class's year step, so start_new_season makes that edition.
 * The base game (2001/02, changing rules off) and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off get none of it (Q342).
 *
 * A competition that the table never holds again waits for the year NEVER. Its menus still list it (the menus
 * walk the entry arrays, 0x49d156); what its screens show of that year is unknown (doc section 3.2).
 *
 * The year steps (doc section 5): the Club World Championship (+2 at 0x929d9e) and the Oceania Champions Cup
 * (+2 at 0x797dbe) step by 1 in a season game (tools/recomp/seasons.py, rt_club_world_step), and the Club
 * World Championship then draws on 1 July, after the update day of 20 June (rt_club_world_month and
 * rt_club_world_day at 0x929c39 and 0x929c3b): with the original's 5 February the draw date of the next
 * edition is past when start_new_season runs, and the class then never draws again (0x92a73d..0x92a74f). The
 * first edition loop of its constructor (0x92919c..0x9291bd) keeps an even year in a season game
 * (rt_club_world_annual, 0x9291b0). */
