/* The league phase in the game (season_uefa_league.h), 0.6.0 slice 25. Evidence:
 * docs/research/2026-10-19-uefa-league-phase.md.
 *
 * A league phase is one League_Stage of 36 clubs (League_Stage::League_Stage 0x68b100, thiscall, 22 arguments,
 * ret 0x58 at 0x68b4c1), as the group stages of the original's cups are (draw_phase1_groups 0x5858b6). Its
 * constructor calls League::create_fixtures 0x6835c0 (0x68b3b9) when it has a round table (+0xba). That
 * function has two paths: a round robin (0x683ac9), or a fixed list at +0xea when the year word +2 of its first
 * entry equals the league's year +0x40 (0x68382e..0x68383d). The fixed list is an array of 16-byte entries made
 * with new[] (the count before the first entry, deleted at 0x683aa1..0x683abe with the empty destructor
 * 0x5a53c0): entry d * (clubs / 2) + i is match i of match day d (0x6838ef..0x683906), +8 the home club id and
 * +0xc the away club id (compared with the club id of each table row, +0xb1 rows of 0x3b bytes, 0x68392f..
 * 0x68395a), +2 the year. The date of each match is the date of its match day in the round table (0x6839f8..
 * 0x683a10). The Italian lists of the original are made so (fixed_fixture_set_by_club_names 0x68aff0 writes the
 * ids at +8 and +0xc). So the league phase gives its constructor a round table of 8 (or 6) match days and puts
 * the matches of the draw (season_uefa_league_draw.c) into +0xea: the wrap of 0x6835c0 below writes the list
 * into the one object that is being made, just before the original reads it.
 *
 * The end of the stage. League::check_complete 0x689ad0 wants each table row's played count (row +0x11) to reach
 * +0xa7 (0x689b47..0x689b58). The constructor sets +0xa7 from its twentieth argument (0x68b215, 0x68b228); -1
 * there means (clubs - 1) * meetings (0x689b1d..0x689b36), 35 for 36 clubs. The league phase passes its match
 * count, 8 or 6. */
