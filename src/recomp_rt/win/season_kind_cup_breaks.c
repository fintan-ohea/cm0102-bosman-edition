/* Rule kind "cup_breaks" of the season change (season_change.h): the domestic cups of the original play an
 * edition only in the seasons that the rules table holds them (0.6.0 slice 21b, docs/research/
 * 2026-10-18-cup-breaks.md). Examples: the Coupe de la Ligue is not held from 2020/21, the Welsh Premier Cup from
 * 2008/09, the Norwegian Cup in 2020, the Leinster Cup from 2002/03 to 2008/09.
 *
 * The edition of a cup is its season year (+0x40). Every class below adds 1 to +0x40 in start_new_season before
 * it builds the rules, the round table and the dates of the new edition (FraLgeCup 0x5bd4be, WelPrmCup 0x928261,
 * NorCup 0x78fc2e, and the others in the table), and none of them calls start_new_season outside the season pass
 * (no call of vtable +0x8 in their files; the pass call is at 0x5d5d1c). season_cups.h maps an edition to its row.
 *
 * In a game (changing rules on, or the start season): in the before hook of start_new_season of season S, a cup
 * whose edition S the table does not hold calls season_change_skip(). The cup keeps its finished edition, makes
 * no fixtures and plays no matches (docs/research/2026-10-18-club-world-idle.md, section 3.2: all_stages_complete
 * stays true, the season-end work runs once). The pass asks again on the next update day, and the kind skips
 * again while the table does not hold the cup. A cup that the table holds again resumes: its year is the
 * edition before the gap, so the hook sets +0x40 to S - 1, and start_new_season builds edition S with dates in
 * the future. Why a skip and not a wait (+0x40 at the next edition, as season_kind_club_world.c does): six of
 * these classes make the fixtures of the new edition inside start_new_season (League::create_fixtures 0x6835c0
 * called at 0x9282f8 by WelPrmCup, and by KorLeagueCup, IreLgeCup, ItaCCup, NirLgeCup and WelLgeCup), and every
 * class picks its clubs there (FraLgeCup 0x5bd4d0). A wait would put the fixtures of the next edition into the
 * clubs' fixture lists a season or more early, with clubs of the season before.
 *
 * At a new game of a season game (start year not 2001; a 2001 game keeps the original's 2001/02): the
 * constructor builds the first edition from its year argument (thiscall: year, record; ret 8, every constructor
 * below). When the table does not hold that edition:
 *   - with changing rules on, the wrap gives the constructor the year of the next edition that the table holds, so
 *     the cup waits (its dates lie in the future; the club world doc, section 1);
 *   - with changing rules off, the cup stays off for the whole game (Q232: the rules of the start season stay), as
 *     a cup that the table never holds again: both get SEASON_CUPS_NEVER (2999).
 * For such an object the League::create_fixtures call of its constructor makes no fixtures (wrap below), so no
 * fixture of the year 2999 reaches a club's list, and a League class gets +0x45 (drawn) 0 after its constructor:
 * League::check_complete 0x689ad0 then returns false at 0x689af6 and League::update_for_date 0x6847c0 does nothing
 * at 0x684811 (IreSuperCup::update_for_date 0x63b300 draws only when +0x40 is the year at [0xde1f58]+0x439,
 * 0x63b324..0x63b331). Without that, a League with no fixtures could count as complete: the played counts of its
 * table rows (+0x11) are compared with the matches per club +0xa7 (0x689b47..0x689b58), and a table with no rows
 * passes. A Cup class never draws (its draw dates lie in 2999, Cup::update_for_date 0x51fa45..0x51fa6d), so
 * Cup::check_complete 0x521e00 never sees +0xb1 set. So the pass never calls start_new_season for the object
 * (all_stages_complete 0x48ce10 is false), and it cannot make the edition of 3000 with fixtures.
 *
 * The base game (2001/02, changing rules off) and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off get none of it (Q152, Q342): no hook
 * runs there, and the wraps test season_game(). RECOMP_CUPS=off turns this kind off too (a test switch of
 * slice 21). */
