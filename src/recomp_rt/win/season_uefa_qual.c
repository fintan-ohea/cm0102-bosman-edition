/* The qualifying rounds of the Champions League and the Europa League in a season of the access list (0.6.0
 * slice 23, Q369, Q296; season_uefa.h). Evidence: docs/research/2026-10-18-uefa-2009-2020.md.
 *
 * The seeding (season_uefa_seeding.c) gives each club an entry code of the access list (SEASON_UEFA_CL_*,
 * SEASON_UEFA_EL_*). This file builds both cups from those codes, in place of the original's fixed counts:
 *
 * Champions League (EuropeanCup, vtable 0x96a1d0). build_entrants 0x584fa0 wants exactly 71 clubs with codes 1
 * to 4 (0x584faa, caps 0x585095..0x585135). The entry table 0x584990 makes 55 slots (0x5849a5) of the Q1, Q2
 * and Q3 clubs. Create_round_table 0x583c50 with stage -1 makes 3 rounds (0x583c9b). Here the list +0x14 holds
 * every entrant: the group clubs first, then the qualifying clubs. The entry table holds the qualifying clubs
 * by round from the lowest (PR, Q1, Q2 CP, Q2 LP, Q3 CP, Q3 LP, PO CP, PO LP), then the group clubs after the
 * first 16. The round table has one round for each round the row plays (codes 240 PR, 250 Q1, 260 Q2, 270 Q3,
 * 220 PO: the round names table gives their real names, season_round_names.h). The group draw
 * draw_phase1_groups 0x585290 takes the 16 clubs of list slots 0 to 15 and the clubs with entry byte +5 = 1
 * (0x585358..0x5853ba, 32 in all): the play-off winners get 1 from the last round (0x51af97), and the group
 * clubs after the first 16 get 1 here, after map_fixture_tree. Their slots come after every slot that a round
 * uses, so the completion test 0x51b039..0x51b06d does not see them.
 *
 * The paths. map_fixture_tree 0x518790 (vtable +0x94) makes the ties of every round at the season start: two
 * sides of entry slots (+0, +2; -1 for a winner to come), the source tie and round of each side (+0xa/+0xe
 * home, +0xc/+0x10 away) and where the winner goes (+6 tie, +8 1 home 0 away, +0x12 round; words, 0x518ef1..
 * 0x518fa7). Its draws put winners and new clubs in any tie, so a champion could meet a non-champion. Here the
 * wrap of 0x518790 writes the ties again after the original: a Champions Path tie has only champions (new
 * champions and the winners of the Champions Path ties below), a League Path tie only the other clubs, each
 * winner of the round below meets a new club when it can (as the seeded draw 0x51d2d0 does), and the rest
 * meet each other at random (0x90cfc0). Every round has flag 0x200 of +0xd, so the draw 0x51c410 keeps the
 * ties (0x51c5d4..0x51c5f1) and only applies the home and away rules (0x51e870, 0x522610).
 *
 * Europa League (Uefa_Cup, vtable 0x970790). build_entrants 0x902b90 (wrapped in season_uefa_cup.c) gives way
 * to uc_access_entrants: the qualifying clubs by round from the lowest (each round: its new clubs, then slots for
 * the Champions League losers that the drops of the row send to it), the group clubs, 16 slots for the
 * Champions League play-off losers (the original's hand-over at count - 0x18, 0x585a02, in draw_phase1_groups),
 * and 8 slots for the Champions League group thirds (count - 8, 0x586282). The rounds are drawn by the
 * original (seeded, 0x400): the new clubs of a round have a higher tier byte +4 than the winners. A round with
 * an empty slot waits (0x51c46d, 0x51c9ab), so the losers of each Champions League round are put into their
 * slots on the days after that round ends (the wrap of Cup::update_for_date 0x51f890 for the Europa League),
 * and the dates of each Europa League round come after the Champions League round that feeds it. The group
 * stage of season_uefa_cup.c takes the play-off winners and every club of the slots after the rounds.
 *
 * Conference League (slice 24, part b: a second object of the Uefa_Cup class, season_uefa_cup_kind 'k'). It is
 * built as the Europa League, with codes 21 to 25 and one path a round: its qualifying clubs by round from the
 * lowest, each round with slots for the losers of the other two cups that the row's ecl_drops send to it, then
 * its group clubs, the slots of the Europa League play-off losers for the groups and 8 slots for the Europa League
 * group thirds (the knockout round play-offs, season_uefa_cup.c). The Champions League losers come as they come
 * to the Europa League. A Europa League loser is a side of a tie of its round whose entry byte +5 is -1 (set at
 * 0x51b5cd when a club goes out) and that is in no tie of the next round, so each loser is found as soon as its
 * tie ends; it takes the slot of its tie. */

 *   Champions League: the preliminary round (2018/19 on) is a tournament of single matches, as the real one

 *   August, second legs 7 days later (+0x22), the last by 8 September.
 *   Europa League: one day after the Champions League (Thursday). The preliminary round has two legs, on the
 *   Sunday and the Tuesday before its first qualifying round. So each round starts after the Champions League
 *   round whose losers it takes has ended (the preliminary round and Q1 before EL Q2, Q2 before EL Q3, Q3 before
 *   EL PO), and its play-offs end the day after the Champions League's: the hand-over of the play-off losers (at the
 *   Champions League group draw) comes before the Europa League group draw.
 * The real calendar starts in late June (rows uefa-66 to uefa-160): these dates keep its order in fewer weeks. */

 * in the first free slot of its pot in the four groups of its half (0x58565a..0x585699). A pot has 4 slots in
 * each half. A club whose half is full is not put anywhere, and its group row stays empty (the pointer of the
 * entry is zeroed only when a club is put, 0x585693). The group draw news then reads the nation of that club
 * (0x5857f4, 0x9058b0, Database.cpp 13126 at 0x53b407): the box. The halves of the partners of an earlier pot
 * come before the pot is drawn: when 5 clubs of a pot have a partner in an earlier pot, and that partner has the
 * same half for all 5, the pot has 5 clubs for the 4 slots of a half. A pair of one nation inside the pot takes
 * one slot of each half, so 4 such clubs and one such pair also leave a club with no slot.
 *
 * This file. For a Champions League of the access list, before the draw: the same sort (the game's qsort) and
 * pairs, and when a pot has 5 or more clubs with a partner in an earlier pot or pairs in the pot (a pair counts
 * once), a choice of the half of each club
 * (the partners in opposite halves, 4 of each half in every pot), found by search. The hook on the random function
 * (win.h) then returns the number that gives that half at the call at 0x5855b7 (return address 0x5855bc). The
