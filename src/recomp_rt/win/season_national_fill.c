/* The fill of a short national side before its match (season games only).
 *
 * VIRTUAL_STAFF::fill_fixture_squads 0x90d2f0 tops up both sides of a fixture (0x90dae0 at 0x90d3bd and 0x90d3f4).
 * The top-up gives no virtual players to the side of a nation with a reputation above 500 (0x90dd5d..0x90dd73),
 * so a national side with few players stays short. The original then shows virtual_staff.cpp 195 (0x90d4bc) and
 * plays on with no check (0x90d4dc); in a season game the wrap in season_records.c skips the box. With fewer than
 * 11 the team pick stops the match at match_eng.cpp 612 or 652 (init_match 0x6b7f20, 0x6b89be): Holland U21 had 10
 * players in an Under 21 International in August 2024 (2023 start, October 2023 database, after a load).
 *
 * season_national_fill fills such a side after the top-up, as the top-up does for clubs: a national side (club id
 * from clubs - 2 x nations, database_is_national_team 0x53b900) with fewer than FILL_TO players it can field (in
 * its squad slots, not injured and in no other national squad) takes the
 * players of its nation (staff +0x1a, or the second nationality +0x1e, as 0x53d980 reads both) by current ability (player row +0x05), those not injured (status 2 of
 * Injury::get_player_injury_status 0x62c400, as count_available_players 0x90da0f skips), and for an under-21 side
 * (id from clubs - nations, 0x5409b0) only those born in the year 21 before the game year or later, and none in
 * the squad of another national side (called_up). */
