/* The Argentine second division's table in a season game (0.6.0 fix: "virtual_staff..cpp 195").
 *
 * ArgSecond::fill_league_table 0x407cd0 (thiscall, no argument) sets +0x3e to 25 (0x407ce2), mallocs the table
 * (0x407ce8) and adds each club whose division (+0x57) is the record of key id [0x9cf658] and whose zone record
 * (+0x60) is set (0x407d78..0x407d8f), up to 25 (0x407da2..0x407daa). With exactly 24 it adds the fixed club of
 * key id [0x9d020c] (0x407dc0..0x407de5: it writes that club's +0x57 when it differs) as the 25th.
 *
 * In a season game slice 15's club moves give the division its real clubs (season_clubs.c). A club that comes
 * in from outside the Argentine zones has no zone record, so only 24 count, and the fixed club fills the place.
 * In the season databases that club is Huracán de Tres Arroyos with no nation and no players (Autumn 2013:
 * record 5215, nation -1, A Lower Division). Its first match then stopped at virtual_staff.cpp 195
 * (VIRTUAL_STAFF::fill_fixture_squads 0x90d2f0, box at 0x90d4c1: fewer than 15 filled squad slots of +0xd7 after
 * the virtual players of 0x90dae0, which gives a club with no nation none): a 2013/14 game in its first August.
 *
 * So in a season game, for the call:
 * - a club of the division with no zone record counts: its +0x60 takes the zone record of another club of the
 *   division for the call and gets its own value back after it;
 * - when only 24 count and the fixed club has no nation or no squad, the key id points for the call at the
 *   Argentine club with no division and a zone record that has the highest reputation (+0x80).
 * The base game keeps the original's path. */
