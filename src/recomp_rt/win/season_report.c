/* The rules report and the season jump (0.6.0 slice 12, Q265). Test runs only: without the variables below
 * the human turn calls season_report_turn, which returns at once and changes nothing.
 *
 * RECOMP_RULES_REPORT=<file>: the runtime writes the competitions that the game holds, twice for each season:
 *   start  at the first human turn of the game, then at the first human turn on or after 1 August;
 *   end    at the first human turn on or after 1 June of the next year (before the update days of the league
 *          table entries, mostly 20 or 21 June: 2026-10-16-sweep-season-end.md, section 2.1). A national team
 *          tournament makes its team list after the start (the World Cup holds 0 clubs on 14 July 2001).
 * It only reads the game's memory.
 * At each start it also writes the clubs of each division (club lines, slice 15). RECOMP_RULES_REPORT_STOP=start
 * ends the program with code 0 after the first start report (the club moves and names of a start season).
 * RECOMP_DATA_SWEEP=1 (0.6.0 slice 30a, check 4 in data form; with RECOMP_RULES_REPORT): at each start and end
 * report the runtime also checks every competition object and each built stage of it (stage array +0xc, slots 0
 * to the current stage +0x30, at most the count +0x2c) and writes a "sweep" line for each fault, and one
 * "sweepok" line a report with what it read:
 *   - date: a round whose year is outside the edition (the year +0x40 of the object that holds the round table,
 *     less one to plus two), or whose day is not a day of the year. Cup rounds: table +0xa3, +0x3c rounds of 0x68
 *     bytes, the draw day word +0 and its year offset byte +2 (cup_set_round_draw_date 0x521e60 at 0x521ea6,
 *     0x521ea9), the match day word +3 and its year offset byte +5 (cup_set_round_match_date 0x521eb0). League
 *     rounds: table +0xba, +0xa9 rounds (word, 0x68b158) of 0x41 bytes, the day word +0 and the year offset word
 *     +2 (league_round_set_date 0x68a160 at 0x68a1a5, 0x68a1ac). These are the dates that the Schedule and
 *     Fixtures tabs of the competition screen show. An object waiting for an edition in 2999 or later (slices 21b,
 *     26) is left out;
 *   - empty: a league (kind league) that has drawn its fixtures (+0x45 1, Comp::Comp 0x48c5bb) while the rules
 *     table gives its season clubs, with no club in its table (+0x3e 0) or an empty row (table +0xb1, rows of
 *     0x3b bytes, the club at +0, 0x6826d0).
 * It only reads memory.
 * RECOMP_SEASON_JUMP=<year>: the game plays on with no match engine, and the program ends with code 0 after
 * the end report of the season that starts in that year. The test steps put the manager on holiday
 * (tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py), so the days pass with no input. A value that is not a year from 2001
 * to 2099 stops the program at the start (season_report_init).
 *
 * No match engine: the original has a switch for it, ENABLE_MATCH_ENGINE=NO in its setup file
 * (create_game_from_setup_file 0x827110 compares with "YES" 0xa812c0 and "NO" 0xa812bc and writes the byte
 * 0xa5a390 at 0x8277a6 and 0x8277cf; it is 1 in the data of the exe). With the byte 0, MATCH_DAY::play_matches
 * 0x6b4360 plays the human club's match with the others (the test at 0x6b4a29 skips the deferred path at
 * 0x6b4df5), and CM3_MATCH_ENGINE::init_match 0x6b7f20 sets its quick flag (0x6b85fb..0x6b8604), so every
 * match is played by the quick result engine CM3_MATCH_ENGINE::quick_simulate_match 0x6beeb0. The results go
 * through match_day_apply_match_result 0x6b5f00 into each competition as in a normal day, so the tables,
 * prize money, history, records and the end-of-season step run (docs/research/2026-10-16-sweep-season-end.md,
 * section 2.4). The fifth reader, match_stats_get_record_bucket 0x729bd0, returns bucket 3 at 0x729c32 only
 * with the byte 1. The jump writes the byte at the first human turn, after the game is made.
 *
 * What the report reads, for each competition object (docs/research/2026-10-17-rules-report.md):
 * - The objects: the table g_comp_object_table [0xadadfc] with [0xadadf8] slots, one per club competition
 *   record (built by 0x8386f0 from the count 0xae2378), and the competition arrays of the 35 league table
 *   entries at 0xb63d60 (0x48 bytes each; +0xc count, +0x10 array; game_season_update_pass 0x5d5cab..0x5d5cbb).
 *   An object in both is written once.
 * - +0 the vtable: the class and its source file (season_comp_classes, tools/seasons/make_comp_classes.py).
 * - +4 the competition record (club_comp.dat or nation_comp.dat, 0x6b bytes): +0 its id, +4 its long name
 *   (docs/research/2026-10-13-database-inventory.md; the record is read at 0x689b66 and 0x48f2df).
 * - +0x40 the season year (s16; League start_new_season adds 1, for example 0x574c10).
 * - +0x3e the club count (s16): a league compares each table row with it (League::check_complete 0x689b3d);
 *   a cup sets it in its constructor (EngCcCup 0x56c32d: 92).
 * - +0x3c (s16): for a league, the times that each pair of clubs meets ((clubs - 1) * +0x3c = matches per
 *   club, 0x689b27..0x689b36); for a cup, the round count (Cup::map_fixture_tree 0x51879c).
 * - +0x4a substitutes used and +0x49 substitutes named (bytes; Comp::Comp 0x48c5c9 sets 5 and 3;
 *   Comp::set_fixture_substitutes 0x48f2fa..0x48f32d packs them into the fixture).
 * Leagues only (set_up_rules, for example EngFirst 0x572d90 and EngPrm 0x574b70):
 * - +0xa7 (s16) matches per club (0x689b1d).
 * - +0xbe promotion places: League::has_automatic_promotion 0x684790 reads it (EngFirst 2, EngPrm 0).
 * - +0xbf promotion play-off places (EngFirst 4, EngThird 4 at 0x578104; inference from the values).
 * - +0xc0 places beside both ends that are neither safe nor direct (League::update_positions_and_status
 *   0x6852b3..0x6852e4 adds it to +0xbe at the top and to +0xc1 at the bottom; 0 in England; inference:
 *   relegation play-off places).
 * - +0xc1 relegation places: League::has_relegation 0x6847b0 reads it (EngPrm 3, EngFirst 3).
 * - +0xd9 (u16) rule flags: bit 1 automatic promotion (0x68479a), bit 0x20 status marks (0x6852a0).
 * - +0x1c and +0x20 (s32) the record ids of the divisions above and below: EngFirst 0x572dea and 0x572df6
 *   store the key ids [0x9cf5bc] (English Premier Division) and [0x9cf5c4]; EngPrm 0x574bd0 stores -1. */
