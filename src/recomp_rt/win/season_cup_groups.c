/* Group stages in domestic cups (0.6.0 slice 21c, docs/research/2026-10-18-cups-more.md, section 1): a group stage
 * that feeds a knockout stage, for a Cup class of the original in the seasons of season_cup_groups (season_cups.h):
 * the Scottish League Cup from 2016/17, the EFL Trophy from 2016/17 and the Turkish Cup in its group seasons.
 *
 * It is built as the Coppa Italia builds its stages (ItaCup: League_Stage groups, create_group_stage 0x63f640, then a
 * Cup_Stage knockout from the rounds of its create_schedule stage 7, create_knockout_stage 0x63f870) and as slice 22
 * builds the UEFA Cup groups on the Cup base (season_uefa_cup.c). A Cup object plays its own round table first (the
 * base rounds, while +0xb1 is 0), then its stages: Cup::update_for_date 0x51f890 updates every stage up to +0x30
 * (0x51f957) and, once +0xb1 is set and every stage up to +0x30 is complete, calls slot 10 (advance_stage) while
 * +0x30 < +0x2c - 1 (0x51f8da..0x51f8f5), else records the season. In a season with a group format:
 * - after the class's create_round_table (stage -1, vtable +0x3c; called by set_up_rounds at each new season and by the
 *   constructor) the object gets +0x2c = groups + 1 stages. With no base rounds +0xb1 is set at once, so the first
 *   update calls slot 10; with base rounds the table keeps its first base_rounds rounds, and the clubs of the later
 *   slots, which no base round takes, are marked 0xff after map_fixture_tree 0x518790 resets them (the cup counts its
 *   base rounds done when no club has 0, process_fixture 0x51a150 at 0x51b3c8), so the base rounds end as before;
 * - slot 10 with +0x30 = -1 draws the groups (League_Stage 0x68b100, one per group, in stages 0 to groups - 1): the
 *   winners of the last base round (entry byte +5 = 1, 0x51b2b9) and the later slots, or with no base rounds every
 *   club of the team list, less the byes (the clubs whose +0x1db is the Champions League or the UEFA Cup, the test of
 *   ScoLgeCup::collect_entrants 0x7f0400), in pots by division level and last place;
 * - slot 10 with every group complete draws the knockout (Cup_Stage 0x522e00 in stage groups): the group winners, the
 *   byes, the other places that go through and the best of the next place (points per match, goal difference, goals),
 *   seeded clubs against the others, not of their own group when a draw is found, on the rounds of the format.
 * The season's honours come from the knockout stage (the wraps of Cup::record_season_honours 0x519a90 in
 * season_uefa_cup.c and of 0x595160), and Cup::update_staff_records_for_status 0x519890 runs as for a cup with no
 * stages (it does nothing with +0x2c > 0, 0x5198a3), as slice 22 does for the UEFA Cup. A save keeps +0x2c, +0x30 and
 * the stages (Cup::save_cup_to_disk 0x5210f0); the stage array is made before a load (season_cup_groups_load).
 *
 * The EFL Trophy (EngAutoCup) is a Cup with two stages of its own: its regional half in a Cup_Stage
 * (create_section_stage 0x56bab0, from the clubs at +0xb2) and the final (advance_stage 0x56bc50,
 * create_final_stage 0x56bce0). In a group season the team list takes the clubs of both halves, the section stage
 * is not made, slot 10 is the group draw, its rank_teams 0x56c010 (it reads the team list of stage 0 at 0x56c06b)
 * does not run, and its slot 12 0x595160 (the honours of stage 1) takes the knockout stage.
 *
 * The base game (2001/02, changing rules off) and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off get none of it (Q152, Q342). */
