/* The league phase of the UEFA club competitions, 2024/25 on (0.6.0 slice 25; research
 * docs/research/2026-10-19-uefa-league-phase.md).
 *
 * The draw (season_uefa_league_draw.c, no game memory, ctest season_uefa_league): 36 clubs in pots by seed. With
 * 8 matches (Champions League, Europa League) the pots are 4 of 9, and each club meets two clubs of each pot, one
 * at home and one away. With 6 matches (Conference League) the pots are 6 of 6, and each club meets one club of
 * each pot; of the pots 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6 it plays one at home and one away. Two clubs of one nation do
 * not meet, and a club meets at most two clubs of one nation (regulations of 2024/25, Art. 16.02). When no draw
 * is found with these rules in many tries, the second rule is dropped, then the first (as Art. 16.03 lets UEFA
 * change them). Then the matches go into match days, each club once a match day. */
