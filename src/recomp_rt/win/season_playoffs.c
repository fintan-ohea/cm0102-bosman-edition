/* Promotion play-offs in leagues whose class has none (0.6.0 slice 19; spec Q247, Q272; research and design in
 * docs/research/2026-10-18-playoffs-splits-calendar.md).
 *
 * Which leagues. A league row of the rules table whose play-off text gives four places in a row just below the
 * direct places ("3rd to 6th", tools/seasons/encode_leagues.py, season_league_table.c), of a League class with
 * no play-off code of its own: advance_stage (vtable +0x28) is the empty function 0x5a8f60 and the result
 * handler (+0x44) is the base League one 0x686940. Examples: the Segunda from 2010/11, the Turkish second tier
 * from 2010/11, each only when the division above relegates the direct places and one more (see balanced).
 * So not the Conference (League Two relegates 1) and not the Greek second tier (GrePrm relegates 2). J2 and the
 * Argentine second tier have no set_up_rules wrap of slice 18, so they get no play-off. A class with its own
 * builder (England, Serie B, Norway, Ireland and the others of the doc) keeps the original's play-off.
 *
 * How. After each set_up_rules of such a league (vtable +0x8c: the constructor and start_new_season call it;
 * season_sizes_rules of slice 18 calls season_playoffs_rules at its end), the direct places +0xbe become the
 * places above the play-off, the play-off places +0xbf 4, and the stage count +0x2c 1 with no stage yet (+0x30
 * -1). The row is that of the start season at a new game and with changing rules off (Q232), else that of the
 * league's edition, as slice 18 reads it. League::update_for_date 0x6847c0 then calls advance_stage on the day
 * the table is complete (0x6849d1..0x6849e3: check_complete(0, 0) first), and the wrap of 0x5a8f60 (season_uefa_cup.c calls
 * season_playoffs_advance) builds the stage as EngFirst::create_playoff_stage 0x573080 does: the round table of
 * EngFirst's +0x3c 0x571980 (stage 0: two-leg semi-finals and a one-match final, codes 0x82 and 0x96; it reads
 * only the year +0x40), new dates from the day after the table is complete, the clubs 6th v 3rd and 5th v 4th
 * (fixed pairs, flag 0x200), Cup_Stage::Cup_Stage 0x522e00 and Cup::set_up_round 0x51c800. The season of the
 * league closes when the stage is complete (0x6849aa..0x6849cf, check_complete 0x689bbc..0x689be8). The results
 * of the stage reach the league's +0x44 with a stage id (Comp 0x519690, 0x5196f2..0x51970c): the wrap of
 * 0x686940 hands them to the English handler 0x576c50, which gives the final's winner status 0 (0x576d9e), so
 * the promotion chain moves it up (league_promote_and_relegate 0x689c80, status 0 or 5). It reads only base
 * League fields (+4, +0x3e, +0xb1).
 *
 * Save and load. The base League save 0x6891c0 and load 0x687b10 write and read +0x2c, +0x30 and each stage
 * (Cup_Stage type 1: 0x523eb0 and 0x5230e0, 0x523380), for every class of this kind. The rules: stages[0] is a
 * live object whenever +0x30 >= 0 (0x689918), and +0x2c >= 1 then (0x688e49). The kind sets +0x30 only after
 * the stage exists.
 *
 * The time. The play-off takes 12 days (semi-finals on days 3 and 7, the final on day 11 after the table is
 * complete). A league whose season change (its league table entry's update day, +0x15) comes sooner has no
 * play-off that season: the first play-off place goes up directly, the nearest form (Q247).
 *
 * The places +0xbe..+0xc1 are in the save (0x689589..0x689592), so a loaded game keeps the play-off.
 *
 * The base game and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off: the rule kinds do not run (season_change.c), so no league gets a
 * stage count, and both wraps pass to the original (a league with +0x2c 0 is never marked). The test switch
 * RECOMP_PLAYOFFS=off turns the kind off. */
