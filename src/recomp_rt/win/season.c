/* The season of a game: start year, changing rules and the season part of a save (season.h).
 *
 * The save container (zip.cpp of the original, tools/save/savfile.py): three words (version, flags, count),
 * then 1000 rows of 0x10c bytes (offset, size, name of 260 bytes), then the parts. Version 2 and 4 store each
 * part with the byte run code of zwrite 0x932e10, version 1 and 3 store it as it is (zopen 0x9326e0 maps 1
 * to 3 and 2 to 4).
 *
 * The part bosman_season.dat, version 1, 16 bytes, little endian:
 *   +0  u32 format version (1)
 *   +4  u32 length of the part in bytes (16)
 *   +8  u32 start year
 *   +12 u32 changing rules (0 or 1)
 * A later version only adds fields after these and makes the length larger. A reader takes the fields that
 * it knows and that lie inside the length, and gives the others their old meaning.
 * Version 2 (0.6.0 slice 16) adds the news texts, the changed names and the last season point of the season
 * change after +16 (season_change.h). A game with none of them writes version 1. A later version keeps the
 * fields of version 2 first, so this reader takes them and leaves what follows.
 *
 * The original opens a part by its exact name (zopen 0x9326e0, the name scan at 0x93293b) and extracts only
 * the parts whose name ends in .tmp (load_game_data 0x82a9c0 calls 0x933320 with "*.tmp" at 0x82acbc), so it
 * never reads this part. The runtime adds the part after the save of the game 0x82e430 has written and
 * renamed the file, and reads it before the load 0x82a9c0 runs. Neither touches the game's memory. The
 * proof: docs/research/2026-10-17-season-save-part.md. */
