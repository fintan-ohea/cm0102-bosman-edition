/* The options of the settings file settings.txt in the user folder.
 *
 * The file has one line "name = value" per option, and comment lines that start with "#". The runtime
 * reads every option once at start (options_load). At start it keeps every line as it is, and it adds a
 * line, with one comment line before it, for each option that the file lacks, at the end of the file.
 * A missing file is written with every option at its default. If the file is missing and
 * settings.txt.bak exists (a write that stopped half way), the .bak file is used. A file that exists but
 * cannot be opened is left alone.
 * Later, options_set rewrites the line of one option only. It keeps every other line, comment and
 * line end, and it refuses a file that is not plain text with LF or CRLF line ends.
 *
 * A switch accepts on/off, yes/no and true/false in any case. A value that does not fit the option
 * gets a message on stderr, and the option keeps its default. */
