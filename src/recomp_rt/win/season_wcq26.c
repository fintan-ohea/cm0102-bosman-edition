/* World Cup qualifying from the 2026 cycle (0.6.0 slice 29): the places of each confederation for a World Cup of
 * 48 teams and the play-off tournament of six. Research and evidence: docs/research/2026-10-19-world-cup-48.md,
 * section "Qualifying" (the sites, read in 3.9.68).
 *
 * Gate (wcq26): season_intl_on(), the World Cup year y = campaign +0x40 + 2 is 2026 or later, and the rule
 * edition of that year has 48 teams (with changing rules off a game that starts before 2025/26 keeps the
 * original's shape, Q232). Outside the gate each site gives the original's value, so the base game does not
 * change. Slice 27's sites (season_intl_qual.c) act for 2006 to 2022 only.
 *
 * Places of 2026 (int-world-268 to int-world-297): UEFA 16, CONMEBOL 6 + 1, CONCACAF 3 + 2 (the three hosts
 * qualify as hosts), CAF 9 + 1, AFC 8 + 1, OFC 1 + 1; the play-off tournament of the six gives 2. The shapes:
 * - UEFA (wc_europe_league): 12 groups (pool of 50, capped at 0x919e41 / 0x91a04a: the last two groups of 5,
 *   the others of 4), the winners qualify; 4 single-match paths of 4 in March 2026 from the 12 runners-up and
 *   the 4 best 2024-25 Nations League group winners that were not in the top two of their group. The real 2025
 *   matchdays (groups of 5 from March, of 4 from September). Built on slice 28's 2022 code (season_nl_wc.c).
 * - CONMEBOL: one league of 10, the top 6 qualify, the 7th to the tournament.
 * - CONCACAF: the original's rounds with the three hosts left out (the third through the holder's place of the
 *   pool, 0x916394); the final group of 6 gives 3 direct places and 2 to the tournament.
 * - CAF: a first round of the weakest (2 x (pool - 45) teams), then 9 groups of 5; the winners qualify, the best
 *   runner-up goes to the tournament (real: 9 groups of 6 and a play-off of 4 runners-up, left out).
 * - AFC: the original's rounds; the two final groups of 5 give 4 direct places each, their fifths play the
 *   original's play-off (stage 11), its winner to the tournament; no tie with Europe (stage 12).
 * - OFC: the final's winner qualifies, its loser goes to the tournament.
 * - The tournament: Oceania stages 2 (semi-finals) and 3 (finals), single matches on 26 and 31 March. */
