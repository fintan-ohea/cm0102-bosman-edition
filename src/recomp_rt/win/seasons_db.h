/* Season databases in the download (0.6.0 slice 14; spec docs/specs/2026-10-16-seasons-0.6.0-spec.md,
 * "Seasons and databases").
 *
 * The download holds the 23 season databases of docs/research/2026-10-16-season-database-table.md as zips,
 * Seasons/<name>.zip in the game folder (win_game_dir). A season database is "unpacked" when the save folder
 * holds it in Databases/<name> (dbfolders.h). The first pick of a season unpacks its zip once.
 *
 * Names: <name> is the neutral name of docs/research/rules-0.6.0/databases-signatures.tsv, for example
 * "October 2003". The same table is in the code (seasons_table.c, made by tools/seasons/make_db_table.py),
 * so the game recognises a database by its content (Q264, Q271) and never by its folder name.
 *
 * Seasons are numbered by their start year: 2001 is the season 2001/02, 2025 is 2025/26.
 *
 * For the Choose Season screen (slice 13) the calls are:
 *   seasons_db_scan(&list)           everything the screen shows: 25 seasons, their status, their versions
 *   seasons_db_prepare(year, &r)     starts a season: unpacks its zip once and returns the folder name
 *   seasons_db_identify(folder)      the known database of one folder, or NULL for a Custom database
 * The folder name that prepare returns goes in the option as database = folder:<name>. Every call runs on
 * the caller's thread. An unpack takes a few seconds (up to 67 MB are written). */
