/* Test runs: a save at a fixed game date, for the same-save check (tests/smoke/smoke_run.py
 * --same-save). Only the environment switches it on. Play is unchanged without it.
 *
 * RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS=n: at the first human turn n or more game days after the first human turn,
 * the runtime saves the game as samesave.sav in the game folder of the original (the write goes to the
 * user folder, files.c) and ends the program with code 0.
 *
 * The human turn is FUN_005cde40 (game.cpp). The day loop FUN_005cccd0 calls it once per slice, after
 * the day's processing (docs/research/2026-10-14-assistant-and-days-inventory.md, 2a). The save is
 * FUN_0082e430(path, 0x16), the call of the Auto Save at 0x7617d8. The folder is the save folder of
 * the game options, [0xae3138] + 0xf, as the Auto Save uses it at 0x7617bb.
 *
 * In such a run the save writes zeros in place of the 0x1cc bytes that the save 0x52dad0 copies from its
 * stack into index.dat without setting them (call site index_pad, 0x53142b). Those bytes are left over
 * from earlier code, so two runs that draw different screens could save different bytes with the same
 * game state. In the same way it writes zeros in the word at the end of each row of the save's table
 * (+0x108 of the row), after the name of each row and in the unused rows, which the open of a part 0x9326e0 leaves as they were in
 * the heap (docs/research/2026-10-15-attribute-groups.md). */
