/* Euro qualifying places (0.6.0 slice 27): euro_champ_qual (ctor 0x57ce10, vtable 0x96a0d4) gives the real
 * places of the Euro of 24 teams in a season game (season_intl_on()). The Euro year is the campaign year +0x40
 * plus 2. The base game and every Euro of 16 teams keep the original's places.
 *
 * The original (the 2000 format, read from the code):
 * - Groups: the League object is group A (index -1), stage[0..7] are groups B to I (built at 0x57ff2e, loop
 *   "cmp edi, 8" at 0x57ff34). +0xff is the last group stage (7), +0x100 the stage of the runners-up ranking (8,
 *   built by 0x57f920 and refreshed by 0x57fa10), +0x101 the play-off stage (9, built by 0x57ef50 from the stage
 *   step 0x57ec60 when the stage index reaches +0x100 or +0x101). Stage count 10 (0x57d00b).
 * - Places of a group: the rule bytes +0xbe and +0xbf (set_up_rules 0x57e8f0 at 0x57e95c, 0x57e963), shared by
 *   the group stages (0x57ee22 passes &+0xbe). The stage end (0x684db0..0x68529d) gives the first +0xbe places
 *   code 7 (flag 4 of +0xd9, 0x6851c8) and the next +0xbf places code 1 (0x685213). Code 7 in a group stage
 *   makes the Euro add the team (vtable +0x44 0x57d5b0: 0x57d609), and code 1 of the play-off stage too
 *   (0x57d6a0).
 * - Play-off (0x57ef50): the best runners-up of the ranking qualify (3 with one host, 1 with two: 0x57f014), the
 *   last 6 or 8 of the ranking play two-legged ties (0x57f115, template 0x57d4f3).
 *
 * Euro 2016 (24 teams, campaign 2014): 9 groups (the original's), the top two direct (+0xbe 2), the third
 * ranked (+0xbf 1, the ranking takes place 3 at 0x57fb4f), the best third direct and the other 8 in 4 ties (the
 * original's two-host shape: 0x57f014, 0x57f115, 0x57d4f3). Group sizes 8 of six and 1 of five (room for 53:
 * Group sizes spread the pool over the groups (rt_euroq_group_size). 18 + 1 + 4 + host France = 24.
 * Euro 2020 and later (24 teams): 10 groups (+0xff 8, stage[8] built by the wrap of 0x57ed10), the top two
 * direct (+0xbe 2, +0xbf 0), no ranking stage (+0x100 -1: 0x57ff50 and 0x57ff9c skip 0x57f920 and 0x57fa10).
 * The stage step still calls 0x57ef50 at stage 9 (+0x101), which takes its no-ranking path (0x57ef71: news for
 * the teams that are out) and makes no stage, so the qualifying then ends (the wrap of 0x57ec60 below). 20
 * places. Slice 28 adds the Nations League paths there.
 * Inference: Euro 2028 takes the 2020 shape (the brief names 2020 and 2024).
 *
 * The bytes +0xff..+0x101 are not in the save (the extra save 0x580130..0x5806cc writes +0xf6 and others, not
 * these), so they are set again after a load (ctor epilogue 0x57d03b). */
