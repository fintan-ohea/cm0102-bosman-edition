/* The scaling of the picture to the window (user32.c, 0.6.0 picture fill, spec
 * docs/specs/2026-10-21-picture-fill-spec.md).
 *
 * The picture fills the window at any size, up or down, and keeps its shape. Bars show only where the
 * shape of the window differs from the shape of the picture.
 *
 * With the option sharp_picture ("sharp bilinear"), the game first draws its picture with nearest pixels
 * into a work texture of a whole number of times its size: the smallest whole number that is at least the
 * fit to the window. The work texture then goes to the window with linear filtering. So each letter keeps
 * an even shape, and only the edges of the pixels are soft. At a fit of 1 or less, no work texture is
 * needed: the picture goes to the window with linear filtering. Without the option, the picture always
 * goes to the window with linear filtering (a smooth, softer picture). */
