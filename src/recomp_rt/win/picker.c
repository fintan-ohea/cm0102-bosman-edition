/* The picker of the Assistant drop-down (#12, assistant.c). Research:
 * docs/research/2026-10-15-assistant-pick-inventory.md.
 *
 * The original picks a team only inside a match (0x6db500, 0x6dbc50): it needs the match object and
 * draws random numbers. So the runtime picks the team itself, from the game's own data, and draws no
 * random numbers. It then stores the team with the game's own calls (0x896fe0, 0x896a90, 0x897760), as
 * the original's pick does.
 *
 * The slots are those of the player's active tactic (tactic +0x12d, a position mask per slot), so the
 * formation stays. A player's fit for a slot is the lower of his rating for the position and his
 * rating for the side, from the position ratings of the player data (1 to 20). A player's score in a
 * slot is the average of the key shown attributes of the slot's position times that fit, divided by 20
 * (Max, Q138 to Q140, 2026-10-15). The shown attributes come from the game's getter 0x5431e0 (1 to 20),
 * as the squad screen shows them for the player's own club. The getter does not apply the screen's
 * mask of unknown attributes (0x543280); best XI (picker_compute_view) applies it, so a pick for another
 * club uses only the values the screen shows (Q108, Q111). Current ability is not used: on Max's Yeovil save it put Weale in goal over
 * D. Williams (Agility 20), because fixed attributes such as Agility, Jumping and Technique do not feed
 * current ability. The eleven is the assignment of the highest total
 * value over all slots, found exactly with the Hungarian method (Q130). A player with a fit below 10
 * plays only when no free player has 10 or more for the slot (Q131). The subs then come from the players
 * left over, by the same rule. picker_compute picks without writing (best XI uses it, Q132);
 * picker_pick also stores the pick. 0.3.0 filled one slot at a time, and its swap pass never brought in
 * a bench player: on Max's Yeovil save Warner (a natural DR) sat on the bench.
 *
 * Candidates: the players of the squad (club +0xd7, reserve-team players too, Q134) whom the squad
 * screen shows as able to play the next match. 0x45cbe0 is the screen's own test (0x459b3d): not
 * injured, not loaned out, not banned, not away with a national team and eligible for the competition.
 * A slot of a player who fails it shows red.
 * - best: all candidates.
 * - match_fit: the candidates with condition 90% or more. When too few, the fittest of the others join.
 * - under_21: first the candidates under 21. The empty slots then get the best older players.
 * The candidates of the first group come before all others (weight below), so a slot takes a player from
 * outside the group only when no player of the group can take it with a fit of 10 or more (Q142).
 *
 * Goalkeeper slot: as in the original (0x6e2000, research section "scorer"), a player with a goalkeeper
 * rating below 10 (player data +0x0f) never takes a slot that allows a goalkeeper (position bit 0x1).
 * So no outfield player goes in goal. When no young keeper exists, the best older one takes the slot.
 * With no keeper at all, the slot stays empty.
 *
 * No daily update: the getters for condition (0x62c590), injury (0x62c400) and the squad test (0x45cbe0)
 * first run the daily fitness update 0x62c680, which draws random numbers and changes the player. During
 * the pick the runtime wraps 0x62c680 and skips it, so the pick only reads what the records hold. A
 * record that no screen has updated today shows the value of its last update. */
