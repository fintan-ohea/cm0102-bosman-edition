/* European Championship qualifying with Nations League paths (0.6.0 slice 28, season_nl.h). Research and
 * evidence: docs/research/2026-10-18-nations-league.md, section "Euro qualifying".
 *
 * Euro 2020 and Euro 2024 qualifying played their groups from March to November of the year after the
 * campaign year (int-continental rows 189 and 233), because the Nations League took the autumn before. The
 * class euro_champ_qual plays its groups from September of the campaign year to October of the year after
 * (template 0x57d190, class doc section 4). In a season game the wrap of the template gives those two
 * campaigns the real matchdays (season_nl_qualifying). Slice 27 gives them their ten groups and the top two
 * of each group.
 *
 * The play-off paths. The class's play-off (create_playoff_stage 0x57ef50) pairs group runners-up in two-leg
 * ties in November. For the two campaigns the wrap builds instead the Nations League paths: four (Euro 2020) or
 * three (Euro 2024) paths of four nations that did not qualify from the groups, picked by the ranking of the
 * Nations League edition two years before the finals (season_nl_paths), as one Cup_Stage of two rounds:
 * semi-finals 1 v 4 and 2 v 3, then the path final, single matches in March of the Euro year. Link mode 1 pairs
 * the list two by two (0x524a20) and bit 0x200 of the final's rule flags sends ties 2k and 2k + 1 to final tie
 * k (0x5245c3, class doc 12.1). Only a final winner gets status 1 (0x51af95), so only it goes into the Euro
 * through the class's slot 17 (add_qualified_team, 0x57d6a0). The Euro's seeding and draw then move to after
 * the path finals (+0x13e and +0xb6 of the Euro object, saved at 0x57c5e9 and 0x689411, class doc 12.2).
 *
 * Euro 2028 (docs/research/2026-10-23-euro-2028-qualifying.md, O320). Its four hosts (England, Republic of
 * Ireland, Scotland, Wales) play the qualifying, and two places are kept for the two best-ranked hosts that do
 * not qualify from the groups. The play-off then has the places that are left: with both host places in use 2
 * paths of 4, with one 3 paths of 4 (single matches, as Euro 2024), with none 4 two-leg ties of 8. */
