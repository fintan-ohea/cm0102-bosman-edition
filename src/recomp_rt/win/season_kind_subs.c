/* Rule kind "subs" of the season change (season_change.h; 0.6.0 slice 17): the substitutes used and the named
 * substitutes (the bench) of a competition, from the rules table (columns subs_used and bench, season_rules.h).
 *
 * How the original holds them (docs/research/2026-10-17-season-rules-17.md, section 1):
 * - A competition object keeps the named substitutes at +0x49 (Comp::Comp 0x48c5c9 sets 5) and the substitutes
 *   used at +0x4a (0x48c5cd sets 3). A fixture holds both in the word at +0x4d: the named substitutes in bits 0
 *   to 3, the substitutes used in bits 4 to 7. Comp::set_fixture_substitutes 0x48f2d0 (vtable +0x7c) packs them
 *   when a fixture is made (0x48f2fa..0x48f32d).
 * - Three classes override the slot and still pack the two fields: AusNsl 0x4124e0, FraCup and FraLgeCup 0x5bb100
 *   (a final round sets the named substitutes to 5, 0x5bb10c). GreCup 0x5ea3d0 does not read them: it writes
 *   0x77 (round 10) or 0x37 into the word. The kind changes the nibbles after it with the table's counts.
 * - The match engine and the team screens read the nibbles: the squad is 11 plus the low nibble (for example
 *   0x459aa8, 0x474e49, 0x6d0f8c, 0x6db9ad, 0x8cf8cf), and CM3_MATCH_ENGINE::init_match 0x6b7fe6..0x6b8015 sets a
 *   nibble above 9 to 9. So a count up to 9 works wherever the original reads them (the Greek cup already names 7).
 *
 * The kind writes +0x49 and +0x4a of the competition at the start of the four functions, so the original's own
 * packing, including its fixed rounds, does the rest. It acts only in a season game (start year not 2001, or
 * changing rules on, as slice 15 defines it); the base game and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off keep the original's
 * values (Q342). The season is the start year with changing rules off (Q232), else the season of the pass that
 * starts the competition (the before hook), else the season year of the competition (+0x40). A competition with
 * no row, or a row with no count, keeps what it has.
 *
 * The kind has no new_game, loaded or season hook: the fixtures of the first season are made inside the game's
 * creation, after the start year is set, and the fixtures of each later season in start_new_season (before hook
 * of this file), so the wraps see every fixture. RECOMP_SEASON_SUBS_LOG=1 prints each change. */
