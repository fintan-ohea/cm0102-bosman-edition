/* World Cup qualifying 2006 to 2022 (0.6.0 slice 27): the places of each confederation and the
 * inter-confederation play-offs of the cycles 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022.
 *
 * Gate: season_intl_on() and the World Cup year y of the campaign, y = campaign +0x40 + 2, in 2006 to 2022.
 * The sections use the same year for their hosts (for example 0x910736, 0x920dae, 0x914003). Outside the gate
 * every function here gives the original's value, so the base game does not change.
 *
 * Places in the original (read in 3.9.68). The exempt count of a section is its hosts of year y plus the holder
 * (the holder is off in a season game, rt_intl_wc_holder).
 * - Europe (wc_europe_league 0x918200): exempt count +0xf6 (0x919e4b..0x919f7c). With 0 exempt there are 10
 *   groups (+0xff = 8 at 0x91a0c2), with 1 or 2 there are 9. The group winners qualify (status 7, 0x9189e1).
 *   The play-off (0x919910) takes the N + 1 best runners-up of stage +0x100: N = 8 for 0 or 1 exempt, else 6
 *   (0x919a7e..0x919a94; template 0x918923). One of them, drawn at random (0x90cfc0 at 0x919b4f), plays the
 *   Asian section (news at 0x919c10; getter 0x91def0). The play-off winners qualify (status 1, 0x918a84).
 * - South America (0x9202b0): direct places +0xbe = 4 - SA hosts (+0xee) - Oceania hosts (+0xef)
 *   (0x921098..0x9210ad), one play-off place (+0xbf = 1).
 * - CONCACAF (0x9149f0): final group (stage 6, 0x917830): direct places 3 - exempt (+0xba, 0x91788a), play-off
 *   places 0 (0x917878). Inference: the second byte of that rules array is the count of play-off places (as in
 *   the Asian final groups, 0x913761, where the play-off place is status 1).
 * - Africa (0x90f210): exempt count +0xba (0x9106ae..0x9107db). 0 exempt: first round of all 50 (0x910133,
 *   0x9101d5), then 5 groups of 5 (0x9109e0), 5 winners. 1 exempt: 4 groups, 4 winners. Total 5 with hosts.
 * - Asia (0x911bf0): exempt count +0xee (0x913f7b..0x9140ac). Final groups (0x913740): 2 direct places with 0
 *   exempt, else 1, and 1 play-off place. Stage 11 (0x913bc1) is the play-off, stage 12 (0x913d50) the tie
 *   with the European runner-up. Total 4.5 with hosts.
 * - Oceania (0x91df90): the winner of the final (0x91f640) plays the South American play-off team in stage 2
 *   (0x91f800). The section adds the winner of stage 2 (0x91e937), of either nation.
 *
 * Real places (int-world.tsv rows 29 to 249): UEFA 13 (plus host Germany 2006, Russia 2018), CONMEBOL 4.5
 * (plus host Brazil 2014), CONCACAF 3.5, CAF 5 (plus host South Africa 2010), AFC 4.5 (plus host Qatar 2022),
 * OFC 0.5. The changes here:
 * - E1: Europe with no host plays a play-off of 6 (3 places): 10 + 3 = 13 (2010, 2014, 2022). With one host
 *   it keeps 9 groups and a play-off of 8: 9 + 4 = 13 plus the host (2006, 2018). The group shapes of 2006,
 *   2010 and 2014 stay those of the original (the count is right, the format is not).
 * - E2, E3: no European runner-up goes to an Asian tie: the N best runners-up play the play-off, the next is out.
 * - A1: Asia keeps the format of no host (4 direct places, 3rd places to the play-off) after its pool leaves
 *   out the host (Qatar 2022).
 * - A2, O1: the ties. Asia stage 12 holds the AFC tie, Oceania stage 2 the other tie.
 * - C1: the 4th of the CONCACAF final group gets the play-off place.
 * - S1: South America keeps 4 direct places with a host (Brazil 2014, a pool of 9).
 * - F1: Africa keeps the format of no host (5 places) after its pool leaves out the host (South Africa 2010),
 *   when the pool holds at least 50 nations.
 *
 * Ties (int-world.tsv and the Wikipedia pages of the inter-confederation play-offs, read 2026-10-18):
 * - 2006: CONCACAF 4th v AFC, CONMEBOL 5th v OFC (int-world-57).
 * - 2010: AFC v OFC, CONCACAF 4th v CONMEBOL 5th (int-world-105).
 * - 2014: AFC v CONMEBOL (Jordan v Uruguay), CONCACAF v OFC (Mexico v New Zealand). The tsv (int-world-153)
 *   says only "drawn". Source:
 *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(inter-confederation_play-offs)
 * - 2018: CONCACAF v AFC (Honduras v Australia), OFC v CONMEBOL (New Zealand v Peru). The tsv (int-world-201)
 *   says only "drawn". Source:
 *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(inter-confederation_play-offs)
 * - 2022: AFC v CONMEBOL, CONCACAF v OFC (int-world-249). The real ties were single matches in Qatar in June
 *   2022. Here they keep two legs on the dates of the original's templates (inference: a tie after the World
 *   Cup draw would leave its slot to the draw fill of world_cup seed_teams 0x92f230).
 *
 * A partner that is not known when a tie is built (its section has not decided it) falls back to the
 * original's partner, so the tie always has two teams. Inference, not traced: whether the status bytes that the
 * partner scans read are final when the builders run (Asia stage 12 when stage 11 ends, 0x91351c; Oceania stage
 * 2 when its final ends, 0x91f17b). RECOMP_SEASON_INTL_LOG=1 logs each pairing.
