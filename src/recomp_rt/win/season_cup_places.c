/* Domestic cups with a fixed number of places that a season's divisions leave short (0.6.0 release test, O260 row
 * A6: the causes of the cup place fills of season_cup_entrants.c, cup by cup).
 *
 * The Irish provincial cups.
 *
 * IreLeinsterCup::select_clubs 0x636a80 fills 16 places: four clubs drawn from the Leinster Senior League (the
 * division of [0x9cf854], 0x636b51; shuffle 0x4afbd0 at 0x636bdc, places 0 to 3 at 0x636bea..0x636c08), then the
 * clubs of the Premier and First Divisions ([0x9cf80c], [0x9cf810], 0x636b6d..0x636b77) whose stadium is in one of
 * seven towns (ire_club_is_in_leinster 0x6399c0: Dublin, Bray, Longford, Dundalk, Drogheda, Athlone, Kilkenny) into
 * places 4 to 15 (0x636b8c..0x636ba4). IreMunsterCup::collect_entrants 0x638e30 fills 20: sixteen drawn from the
 * Munster Senior League ([0x9cf850], 0x638f0b; 0x639081..0x6390b5) and four Premier or First Division clubs found by
 * name (Cork City, Cobh Ramblers, Waterford United, Limerick F.C., strings 0x9e9ff4..0x9e9fc0; places 16 to 19 at
 * 0x63902e..0x639046). The season databases from 2008/09 have fewer League of Ireland clubs in those seven towns and
 * other names for some of the four Munster clubs (Waterford FC, Limerick FC), or not the club at all, so places
 * stayed empty (gate (a) run 7: Leinster 1 or 2 of 16, Munster 1 or 2 of 20, ag-cup-fills.md).
 *
 * The real cups are open to the senior league clubs of the province, so after the class's pick an empty place takes
 * the next club of the cup's own provincial league that is not in the list, by reputation (+0x80): no random draw is
 * added, so the rest of the game is as before when no place is empty. Only in a season game (season_game_changes);
 * the base game's lists are full, so it is never reached there (Q152). */
