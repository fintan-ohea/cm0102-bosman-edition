"""Seasons of the club competitions outside UEFA (0.6.0 slice 26, part a): each competition of the original plays an
edition only in the seasons that the rules table holds it (docs/research/rules-0.6.0/club-world.tsv,
src/recomp_rt/win/season_kind_club_world.c).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/club_world_check.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>] [--reuse] [--own-dbs <folder>] [--timeout <seconds>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with England, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Japan
selected (a creator makes its objects only when a nation of its continent is selected, 0x6699d0). The runs:
    2001-on   the 3.9.68 data from 2001/02 with changing_rules on, to 2002/03: the Inter-American Cup and the
              Oceania Champions Cup wait from the new game, the Club World Championship waits for 2005, the Copa
              Mercosur, the Merconorte Cup and the Asian Cup Winners' Cup stop after 2001/02
    2004-on   Summer 2004 (our own database: --own-dbs names a folder that holds it unpacked, made from
              Summer 2004.zip of the release input) with changing_rules on, to 2005/06, with England only
              (entry 2): the Intercontinental Cup stops after 2004/05, and the Club World Championship comes
              back in 2005/06. (A 2003/04 start with October 2003 stops on 7 February 2004 at the box
              "comp_stats..CPP 1664", 0x4a25a8, with England alone too: Comp_Stats::set_club_final_position
              0x4a2540 gets no club. The build without this slice stops there too. Which competition calls it is
              unknown.)
    2004      Summer 2004 (--own-dbs) with changing_rules off, to 2005/06, with England only: the start season
              holds no Club World Championship, so it never comes (Q232), and the Intercontinental Cup plays on
    2007      November 2007 with changing_rules off, to 2008/09: the start season rules at a new game, and the
              Club World Championship in two seasons in a row. (A 2005/06 start stops at the World Cup draw of
              December 2005 with the box "world_cup..cpp 1438", 0x92f2b1, before this slice: fewer than 32
              qualified nations. That is not a rule of this slice.)
    2007-load November 2007 with changing_rules off: the game saves 150 days after the start (11 December 2007,
              after the quarter-finals of the 7-club knockout on 10 December), a new program loads that save,
              returns from holiday and plays 10 days (the semi-finals on 13 December, the final and the third
              place match on 16 December).
              The loaded game must end the knockout with places 1 to 3 (the test log of the history thunk) and
              save again. It needs no Select League(s) nations of other continents: entry 2 is made for every game
    2024-on   October 2024 with changing_rules on, to 2025/26: the Club World Championship of 2024/25 is the
              last in the table. (A 2023/24 start with October 2023 stops in February 2024 at the same
              comp_stats box as a 2003/04 start, also without this slice.)

The checks (each run):
    - the jump ends with code 0 and the report holds the start and end of each season (a stopped run fails)
    - for each object of the classes of the kind and each season S of the report: the object holds year S at the
      start or at the end of S exactly when the table holds the competition in S (an edition of year Y plays in
      game season Y, docs/research/2026-10-18-club-world-idle.md section 6)
    - changing_rules on: the news log of the season change (RECOMP_SEASON_CHANGE_LOG=1) has one sentence for
      each competition that the table starts or stops holding in a season of the run
    - part b: each season that the table holds the Club World Championship with 6 or 7 clubs plays it as a
      knockout of that many clubs (the log line of season_kind_club_world.c); with changing rules off, the club
      count of the start season
    - part 26c: a season with 32 clubs in the table plays the groups of Form G (log line "club world groups")
    - part 26c (Q401): the knockout's first match and final are on the days of the table's format text (December,
      or February for 2020/21 to 2022/23), and when the run reaches the final, places 1 to 3 (Form G: 1 and 2) are
      written on the final's day or at most 7 days later
    - each class whose continent has a selected nation is in the report (NEEDS)
The other runs: 2019-on (October 2019, Oceania into its gap of 2020/21 in the game), 2020-on (November 2020, Oceania
waits from the new game and comes back in 2021/22), 2022-on (October 2022, the Asian Club Championship waits from the
new game and comes back in 2023/24), 2001-all (Select All, so the Merconorte stops after 2001/02), 2002-on, 2008-on
and 2017-on (more start seasons). Runs end before a World Cup draw where they can: a start inside a qualifying
campaign stops at the draw with the box "world_cup..cpp 1438" (0x92f2b1) until slice 27's fix is on main, so 2008-on
and 2017-on end after their start season, and 2020-on crosses the draw of December 2021.
A run takes about 6 to 12 minutes (2001-all longer). --jobs (default 2) runs that many at the same time. --reuse checks the reports
already in the --keep folder again without a new run.
