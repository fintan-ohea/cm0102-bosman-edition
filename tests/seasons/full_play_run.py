"""Full play (0.6.0 slice 30a, gate (b) of docs/research/brief-0.6.0/slice-30a.md): one new game from a start
season, played with the match engine on and the manager on holiday, with a save near each 1 July that a new program
loads and plays on (as tests/seasons/soak_run.py does for the season jump).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/full_play_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --keep <folder> [--start 2001]
        [--seasons 2 | --end 2028 [--end-days 62]] [--nations all|England,...] [--database <folder>]
        [--changing-rules on|off] [--seed 1] [--stall-minutes 20] [--timeout 86400]

The legs. Leg 0 makes the game with the new-game and holiday steps of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py, but
without RECOMP_SEASON_JUMP, so the match engine stays on (the jump turns it off, src/recomp_rt/win/season_report.c).
With RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS=365, at the first human turn 365 game days after its first, the runtime saves
samesave.sav and ends the program (src/recomp_rt/win/testrun.c): a save in July of the next year. Each later leg
copies that save into a new user folder, loads it (tests/fixtures/fixtures.py LOAD_STEPS), plays on and saves
again. --seasons N plays N legs of 365 days. --end E plays to about 1 September of E (rule O166): the legs of 365
days to July of E, then a last leg of --end-days days (62 from 1 July). The rules report (RECOMP_RULES_REPORT) is
written as in the jump.

The checks of each leg:
    - no message box of the game in its log (RECOMP_SCREEN_LOG prints "recomp: message box from", waits.c): the
      script stops the game by its PID at the first one, so a box does not wait for the timeout
    - no stall: once the game is made, the game date (the "date d/y" of the screen log) moves at least once in
      --stall-minutes
    - the program ends with code 0 and leaves samesave.sav in its user folder
At the end, over the reports of all legs: every division's edition moves on from the end of one season to the
next (rules_report_check.league_stalls).
The run folder holds one folder per leg (leg00, leg01, ...) with its stderr.txt, report.tsv and user folder, and
full.tsv with one line per leg (leg, the season it starts in, the result, minutes, the first fault). The script
prints the wall time at each 1 July that the game reaches and waits before each leg while
/Users/max/Projects/cm0102/run-logs/HOLD exists, while 15 or more games run on this Mac, or while the load of the
last minute is 24 or more.
