"""Rules report check (0.6.0 slice 12, Q265): the competitions that the game holds in each season, compared
with the rules table.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py <report> [--expected <name>] [--update-expected]
        [--data <data folder>] [--start-only]
        compares a report with the rules table and lists each difference (--data: the club checks against the
        database of the run)
    python3 tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py --run <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--year y] [--last y]
        [--database <folder>] [--nations england|all|all,-<name>,...|<name,name,...>]
        [--extra conference,regional,c2,spain,portugal]
        [--keep <folder>] [--timeout s] [--start-only] [--update-expected] [--changing-rules on|off]
        plays the season jump, then compares its report

    python3 tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py --league-advance <report> [<report> ...]
        the gate check of the divisions (league_stalls): at the end of each season every division's edition must
        have moved on since the end of the season before; the reports of the legs of one soak read in leg order

Runs:
    per slice   --year X --last X+1: two seasons from the start in X (about 6 minutes with England alone)
    release     the base game from 2001 with --last 2027: 27 seasons (about 65 minutes with England alone)
    start only  --year X --start-only: the report of the first day of a season game, then the program ends
                (RECOMP_RULES_REPORT_STOP=start): the club moves and names of that start (slice 15). Its
                expected file has the name <year>-<nations>-start

The run: a new game (Arsenal, as in tests/smoke/smoke_run.py) with changing_rules = off, then Go on Holiday.
RECOMP_SEASON_JUMP=<last> turns the match engine off, so the original's quick result engine plays every match
in the real day loop. RECOMP_RULES_REPORT writes the competitions at the start of each season (the first day,
then 1 August) and at its end (1 June of the next year) (src/recomp_rt/win/season_report.c). The run ends after
the end report of the last season. --year starts the game in that season (RECOMP_START_SEASON) with the
database folder. --nations picks the leagues on the Select League(s) screen: england (the default
selection), all (Select All), all,-france (Select All, then France out), or names of the first 16 rows
(Argentina to Norway). --extra adds the lower
divisions of the screen: the English Conference, the German regional divisions and Serie C2. --changing-rules on
plays the jump with changing rules on (slice 22; the default is off, the start season's rules). --keep keeps the
report and the log there.

The checks that fail the test (exit code 1):
    - the run ends with code 0 and its report holds the start and end of every season from the start year to
      the last year
    - every competition of the report has a known class (its vtable is in the class table of the build)
    - base game (start 2001): the name of each competition record is the name of that record in
      club_comp.dat or nation_comp.dat of the game folder, and each English division holds as many clubs as
      club.dat puts in it
    - a difference with the rules table that the expected file does not list. The expected files are
      tests/seasons/rules_report_expected/<start year>-<nations>.tsv: one line per difference (season, kind,
      text). A slice that brings a rule removes its lines with --update-expected; a difference that has gone
      is listed, and does not fail the check.

The differences, by kind:
    clubs, subs_used, bench     the game's value at the start and at the end differ from the count of the row
    up, down                    a division's promotion places (+0xbe) or relegation places (+0xc1) differ from
                                the row (a row with a numbered tier); the row's count can also hold the
                                play-off winner (+0xbf) or the play-out losers (+0xc0)
    playoffs                    a division's promotion play-off places (+0xbf) or relegation play-off places
                                (+0xc0) differ from the places of the row's play-off text, as
                                tools/seasons/encode_leagues.py reads it (slice 19). A play-off that moves no
                                club between tiers (a finals series, a European play-off, a tie-break) has no
                                places. For a text that the tool reads only in part, only whether the division
                                has play-off places at all is compared
    name                        the game's name differs from the table's name of that season and from its shown
                                form (tools/seasons/make_names.py shown_name)
    no_row                      the game holds a competition whose file has no row in that season
    not_held                    the game holds a competition (its year is the season, one year before or one
                                after) that the table marks not held in that season
    idle                        the game's object waits for a later edition (its year is later), but the
                                table holds the competition in that season
    club_list                   (a season game, its start season) a division with a club list of the club moves
                                table (tools/seasons/make_clubs.py) whose listed clubs that the database holds
                                are not all in it, or that holds other clubs too: the division keeps the count of
                                its class (slice 18 brings the real count), or the list lacks clubs of the
                                database. The line names each club, so another fill is a new difference
    division_clubs              (slice 18) a league of the size table whose division holds another number of clubs
                                at a season start than its table has rows
    format                      the stages of the Champions League at the end of a season (the uefa line of the
                                report, slice 22): the second group stage and the first knockout round differ
                                from the "Rounds (clubs):" list of the row ("Groups 2 16, KO 8" or "KO 16")
    not_in_game                 a row with no competition in the game, of a nation (or body, such as UEFA)
                                that has a numbered tier in the report, or of a file of the report

The row of a competition: the rows of its file in that season; of those, a row with this file alone before a
row of two files; a row that is not a qualifying path ("qualifying" in comp); then the k-th row for the k-th
object of the same file (the Regionalliga groups).
