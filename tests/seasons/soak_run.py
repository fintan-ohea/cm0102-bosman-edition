"""Long-game soak (0.6.0 slice 30a, check 2 of docs/research/brief-0.6.0/slice-30a.md): one game from a start
season to the end of a last season, played as the season jump (no match engine, the manager on holiday), with a
save near each season change that a new program loads and plays on.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/soak_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --keep <folder> [--start 2001] [--last 2027]
        [--seed 1] [--nations all|England,...] [--database <folder>] [--changing-rules on|off] [--leg-days 365]
        [--timeout 14400]

The legs. Leg 0 makes the game (tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py: the steps of a new game, the season jump to
--last, the rules report) with RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS=<leg days>: at the first human turn that many game days after
its first, the runtime saves samesave.sav and ends the program (src/recomp_rt/win/testrun.c). Each later leg copies
that save into a new user folder, loads it (tests/fixtures/fixtures.py LOAD_STEPS, as season_nl_run.py's
load_and_jump), plays on and saves again. The game starts in July, so each save comes in July of the next year,
near the season change. The last leg (the one that starts in the summer of --last) has no save: the season jump
ends the program after the end report of --last (season_report.c).

The checks of each leg:
    - no message box of the game in its log (RECOMP_SCREEN_LOG prints "recomp: message box from", waits.c): the
      script stops the game by its PID at the first one, so a box does not wait for the timeout
    - the program ends with code 0
    - a leg that must save leaves samesave.sav in its user folder
At the end: the last leg's rules report holds the end of --last. The run folder holds one folder per leg (leg00,
leg01, ...) with its stderr.txt, report.tsv and user folder, and soak.tsv with one line per leg (leg, the season
it starts in, the result, seconds, the first box).

A leg of Select All takes about 20 to 60 minutes on a loaded machine (a 2001 game to 2027/28: 27 legs). The script
starts one game at a time and waits while /Users/max/Projects/cm0102/run-logs/HOLD exists, while 15 or more games
run on this Mac, or while the load of the last minute is 24 or more.
