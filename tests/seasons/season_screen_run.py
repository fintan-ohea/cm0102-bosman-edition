"""Choose Season screen check (0.6.0 slice 13): each tile starts its season database.

Usage:
    python3 -I tests/seasons/season_screen_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> <folder of source zips>
        [--ref-build <program>] [--only <run>] [--shots <folder>] [--own-zips <folder>]

<folder of source zips> is test-fixtures/databases/zips. The run makes the season zips of four seasons with
tools/release/make_season_zips.py and a new game folder: links to the files of <game folder> and Seasons/ with
those zips, as in a download. Each run has a new user folder, -seed 1, the test clock and classic mode.

Runs, played at the same time (one per era, Q240):
    2002    Original era: the 2002/03 tile (3.9.68 data, no unpack)
    2003    2000s: the 2003/04 tile (October 2003)
    2010    2010s: the 2010/11 tile (September 2010 ODB)
    2021    early 2020s: the 2021/22 tile (October 2021)
    2025    league phase: the 2025/26 tile (December 2025)
    2004    with --own-zips: the 2004/05 tile (Summer 2004, our own database, Q351)
    2006    with --own-zips: the 2006/07 tile (Summer 2006, our own database, Q351). <folder> holds the source
            zips of the converted folders; it is a second source of make_season_zips.py.
Each run opens the screen from Setup Game, clicks the tile and Choose, waits for Setup Game, starts a new game
with the steps of tests/smoke/smoke_run.py and saves 1 day after the first news screen. Checks: the first news
screen is in July of the season, settings.txt has database and season of the tile, a zipped database is
unpacked into Databases (the log of seasons_db_prepare), and the save has the season part with the year.

    custom      two Custom database folders in Databases (copies of the clean Data and of the April 2022 database of
                <folder of source zips>/.., each with one byte added to staff.dat, so neither is a known
                database): the Custom tile, Next folder (the second folder), the season arrow three times (2022/23),
                Choose and a new game. Checks: settings.txt has database = folder:B Custom and season = 2022/23,
                and the first news screen is in July 2022.
    base        the 2001/02 tile through the screen with changing_rules = off, saved 14 days after the first
                news screen: the save has no season part and the first news screen is in 2001. The run "ref" plays
                the plain new game (this build, or --ref-build) and the run prints a note whether the saves are the
                same: opening a screen moves the original's memory blocks (Q152), so a difference is expected.
--shots keeps a picture of the screen after the tile click of each run in that folder.
