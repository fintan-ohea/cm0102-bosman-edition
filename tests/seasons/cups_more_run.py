"""Domestic cups, part 21c (0.6.0): four-club super cups, group stages and new cups.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/cups_more_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--keep <folder>]
        [--reuse]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with the nations of its cups selected. The checks
read the "cupmore" lines of the rules report (src/recomp_rt/win/season_super_cups.c: file, year, clubs, rounds,
stages, groups, knockout, winners) and the log (docs/research/2026-10-18-cups-more.md).

The runs:
    i2023   October 2023, changing rules on, 2023/24 to 2024/25, Italy: the Supercoppa Italiana has four clubs and
            two rounds (semi-finals and final) at the new game and after the season change, and its final has a
            winner in the history
    s2019   start run, October 2019, changing rules off, Select All without France: the Supercopa de Espana has four
            clubs and two rounds at the new game
    g2001   the test seam RECOMP_CUP_GROUPS_TEST=1, 2001/02, changing rules on, England: the League Cup plays 16
            groups and a knockout of 32 clubs in 5 rounds (17 stages) and has a winner
    e2016   October 2016, changing rules off, England: the EFL Trophy plays 16 groups (56 clubs) and a knockout
            of 32 clubs in 5 rounds, and has a winner
    n2008   September 2008, changing rules on, 2008 to 2010, Norway: the Norwegian Super Cup is made, plays its
            editions of March 2009 and March 2010 with two clubs, and the row of 2010/11 holds no edition of March 2011
    c2007   November 2007, changing rules off, England with the Conference: the Conference League Cup is made and
            has a winner
    t2010   start run, September 2010 ODB, changing rules off, Select All without France (Turkey, Russia and the
            Republic of Ireland are not in the 16 rows that the steps click): the Turkish Cup has 4 groups after 3
            rounds, the Turkish Super Cup is made with two clubs, the Russian one of March 2011 (the edition of
            the row of 2010/11) with two clubs, the All-Ireland cup with 12 clubs
    r2002   start run, 2002/03 (the original data), changing rules off, Select All without France: the start hook
            makes the editions that the row of 2002/03 holds, the Russian Premier League Cup of 2003 (first round in
            March 2003) with 16 clubs and the Russian Super Cup of March 2003 with two clubs (log lines)

Read runs (fix of 2026-10-21): RECOMP_CUP_GROUPS_READ=1 reads each cup's round table at each report as the Schedule
tab and scout duty do (Comp::build_match_date_list 0x48d500); the groups and the knockout must stay.
    e2016-read  e2016 with the reads: the EFL Trophy keeps its 16 groups and its knockout of 32 to a winner
    x2016-read  October 2016, changing rules off, Select All without France, the season played to its end (about
                an hour): the Scottish League Cup (8 groups, a knockout of 16), the EFL Trophy and the Turkish Cup
                (8 groups after 2 rounds, a knockout of 16) keep their groups to a winner; no error box

Save and load runs (review 1 of 2026-10-20): the first program plays the season jump and saves the game
RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS game days after the start, inside a competition of this part; a second program loads that save
(tests/fixtures/fixtures.py LOAD_STEPS) and plays on with the season jump and the rules report to the end report of
the season. The check reads the loaded program's report and log.
    e2016-load  October 2016, England, changing rules on: saved after 100 days (late October 2016, between the
                second and the third group match day of the EFL Trophy); after the load the knockout of 32 clubs is
                drawn and the Trophy has a winner
    i2023-load  October 2023, Italy, changing rules on: saved after 189 days (20 January 2024, between the
                semi-finals of 18 January and the final of 22 January of the four-club Supercoppa); after the load
                the final is played and the cup has a winner
    n2008-load  September 2008, Norway, changing rules on: saved after 150 days (December 2008, after the module
                made the Norwegian Super Cup of March 2009 on its vtable copy); after the load the cup is played
                and has a winner

A run starts a game only when fewer than 15 games run on this Mac and the load of the last minute is below 24 (Max's
limit), and its game stops when the script stops (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP). Run at most three of these scripts at
a time (--only).
