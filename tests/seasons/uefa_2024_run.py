"""UEFA league phase check (0.6.0 slice 25, 2024/25 on): one table of 36 clubs with 8 matches each (6 in the
Conference League), the knockout phase play-offs of places 9 to 24, and the European Performance Spots.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/uefa_2024_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with England. The runs:
    2024    October 2024, changing rules off, the season 2024/25
    2025    December 2025, changing rules off, the season 2025/26
    change  October 2023, changing rules on, 2023/24 to the end of 2024/25: the news sentences of the change
    load    October 2024: a save in the qualifying rounds (20 days, late July, before the league phase draw, which
            reads the direct clubs of the list +0x14), one in the league phase (120 days) and one in the knockout
            phase (215 days: 13 February, after the play-off draw of 31 January), each loaded by a new program that
            plays to the final
    repeat  two October 2024 games with the same steps give equal saves 130 days after the start (in the league
            phase)
The checks of a season: the jump ends with code 0 and shows no message box of the game; the log of
src/recomp_rt/win/season_uefa*.c shows the access list places, two European Performance Spots, a league phase
of 36 clubs with 8 matches each for the Champions League and the Europa League (6 for the Conference League
when the game has it), every club of each league phase table with all its matches played when the knockout is
drawn, the play-off ties of places 9 to 24 in the pairs of the bracket, and both knockout phases drawn; the uefa
line of the report at the end of the season: 2 stages, 36 clubs in the league phase, a knockout stage of 24 clubs
(16 in the play-offs and places 1 to 8) in 5 rounds, each with a winner; the label of the play-off round is the
real name of 2024/25. A run takes about 15 to 45 minutes on a loaded machine. --jobs (default 1).
