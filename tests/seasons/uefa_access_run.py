"""UEFA 2009/10 to 2020/21 check (0.6.0 slice 23): the access list, the Champions League paths, the Europa
League and the end of the Intertoto Cup, in a game that starts in a season of the access list.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/uefa_access_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with England (changing rules off: the start
season's rules). The runs:
    2010    September 2010 ODB, the season 2010/11 (the format of 2009/10 to 2017/18)
    2018    October 2018, the season 2018/19 (a preliminary round, paths from Q2, four group places for the top
            four associations: England's four clubs in the group stage)
    load2018  October 2018: the game saves 20 days after the start (late July 2018, before the Champions League's
            second qualifying round ends), a new program loads the save and plays to the end of the season (slice
            23 review 2: the draws after a load read the direct clubs of the list +0x14)
    load    September 2010 ODB: the game saves 30 days after the start (August 2010, inside the qualifying
            rounds), a new program loads the save and plays to 1 June 2011; both cups play their group stages and
            knockouts to a winner (the hand-over of Champions League losers after a load)
    2013    Autumn 2013: the Super Cup of 2013 at the row's stadium in Prague (the log line of
            season_uefa_super_cup.c, written when the game is made); the run ends after 600 s (the World Cup box
            of a moved season, world_cup.cpp 1438, slice 27, stops a 2013 start in December)
    repeat  September 2009, twice: the saves 60 days after the start (September 2009, after the qualifying
            rounds) are equal byte for byte; each run ends after 600 s (the same World Cup box in December 2009)
The checks of the season runs: the jump ends with code 0 and shows no message box of the game; the log of
src/recomp_rt/win/season_uefa_seeding.c and season_uefa_qual.c shows the places of the access list, the
entrants of both cups (Champions League 76 clubs, 79 from 2018/19), the Champions League ties in two paths
and the round codes (240, the preliminary round, from 2018/19); the uefa lines of the report at the end of the
season: Champions League 9 stages, 32 clubs in groups, a knockout of 16 and 4 rounds; Europa League 13 stages, 48
clubs in 12 groups, a knockout of 32 and 5 rounds, each with a winner; the round labels of Q370 (Play-off
Round, Third Qualifying Round of the Europa League, Preliminary Round and Preliminary Round Final from 2018/19);
and the Intertoto Cup plays no round.
A run takes about 4 to 40 minutes on a loaded machine. --jobs (default 1). Ctrl-C stops the runner and its
games.
