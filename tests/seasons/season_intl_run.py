"""International competitions check (0.6.0 slice 27): the editions, hosts and golden goal of the finals in a
season jump.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/season_intl_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>] [--reuse]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py (England, the quick result engine) with the
test log RECOMP_SEASON_INTL_LOG=1. The runs:
    2003    October 2003, 2003/04 to 2004/05, changing rules on (Euro 2004, no golden goal from 2004/05)
    2005    September 2005, 2005/06 to 2006/07, changing rules on (World Cup 2006, Australia to Asia)
    2008    September 2008, 2008/09 to 2009/10, changing rules on (the 2010 inter-confederation play-offs)
    2014    October 2014, 2014/15 to 2015/16, changing rules on (Euro 2016 qualifying in full: a draw of 24
            with no fill)
    2015    October 2015, 2015/16 to 2016/17, changing rules on (Euro 2016 with 24 teams)
    2017    October 2017, 2017/18 to 2018/19, changing rules on (the last Confederations Cup lies before)
    2018    October 2018, 2018/19 to 2019/20, changing rules on (Asian Cup and Africa Cup of Nations of 24 teams)
    2019    October 2019, 2019/20 to 2020/21, changing rules on (Euro 2020 and Copa America 2020 at their
            planned time, the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, Q277, Q366)
    2021    October 2021, 2021/22 to 2022/23, changing rules on (the 2022 World Cup in November, Türkiye)
    2023    October 2023, 2023/24 to 2024/25, changing rules on (Copa America 2024 with 16 teams)
    off     October 2017 with changing rules off: the first editions of the table, then the original's steps

The checks (each run):
    - the jump ends with code 0 and the report holds the end of the last season
    - every year that the game holds for a finals class (world_cup, euro_champ, fifa_confed, olympics,
      goldcup, african_nations, asia_nations, oceania_nations) at the first report is the first edition of
      the table from the start season (or the waiting year 2200 when the table has none)
    - on: when the year of a class changes between two reports, the new year is the next edition of the
      table (tools/seasons/make_intl.py); off: the old year plus the original's step
    - no draw after a full qualifying is short (log "short after a full qualifying"; a tie that ends after the
      World Cup draw is not a fault), and the draws of NO_FILL take no team from the fill
    - no inter-confederation play-off is built without a team (log "wc play-off ... v none")
    - a start after the qualifying began takes the real draw and the real play-offs (LINES; O259 A9, A16), and
      every finalist of the real draw is in the data
    - the nation renames of RENAMES and the date moves of MOVES are in the log
    - on: each host row that the runtime writes names the hosts of the table, up to six (log "host")
A run takes about 6 to 8 minutes. --jobs (default 2) runs that many at the same time. --reuse checks the
reports already in the --keep folder again without a new run.
