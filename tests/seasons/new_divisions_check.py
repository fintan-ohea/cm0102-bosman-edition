"""New divisions (0.6.0 slice 20, docs/research/2026-10-20-new-divisions.md): the season end of the 3. Liga, and a
save and a load across a season change for each new tier.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/new_divisions_check.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--keep <folder>]

The runs (changing_rules off, the database of the start season, test-fixtures/databases):
    liga3        2008/09 to 2009/10 with Germany and the regional divisions: at the season change of 2009 the 3. Liga
                 of 2008/09 is complete (+0x4c, set by League::update_for_date 0x684a9e when the season ends with its
                 history and honours) and has no stage (+0x2c 0, +0x30 -1); the log line of the exchange says so
    liga3-load   the same game saved 330 days after the start (June 2009, before the season change); a new program
                 loads the save and plays 30 days, across the change: the 3. Liga ends complete, 20 clubs, no box
    iberia-load  2021/22 with Spain and Portugal (their extra division by RECOMP_TEST_EXTRA), saved after 330 days,
                 loaded and played 30 days: Primera Federación and Liga 3 take their new clubs at the change, no box
    greece-load  2021/22 with Greece, saved after 330 days, loaded and played 30 days: the module makes the second
                 group again from its save file, the group's exchange runs at the change, no box
    por-cup      a 2021/22 start with Portugal's Liga 3 (and every nation below the 16 rows) to its first start report,
                 with the Portuguese Cup's safety net off (RECOMP_BOX_FIXES=off, rt_por_cup_none): the club moves send
                 the clubs that leave Liga 3's group divisions to the Third Division, so the cup finds its 164
                 entrants with no club of no division (O260 A24; before, por_cup.cpp 74)
A run takes about 5 to 25 minutes (iberia-load selects every nation below the 16 rows).
