"""Smoke run: the recompiled game plays the start screen, a new game and some days without a person.

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/smoke_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> <reference folder> [--mode classic|widescreen]
        [--database 3.9.60|3.9.65|3.9.68] [--record] [--tolerance n]
    python3 tests/smoke/smoke_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --same-save [--mode classic|widescreen] [--days n] [--ref-build <program>]
        [--ref-050 <0.5.0 program>] [--ref-setup <name>] [--jobs n] [--runs a,b] [--custom-db <folder>]
        [--save start.sav|prematch.sav]
    python3 tests/smoke/smoke_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --match [--days n] [--speed very-fast|fastest] [--ref-build <program>] [--sleep-danger]

--tolerance n: a colour channel that differs by n or less counts as equal. The Linux build differs from the
Mac reference pictures by 1 in some channels (the compilers round floating point differently), so its
smoke run uses --tolerance 1.

Same-save check (--same-save): the run plays the same new game once per run in SAME_SAVE_RUNS, with -seed 1, the test
clock (RECOMP_FIXED_CLOCK=1) and the same steps to "Go on Holiday". The runtime saves the game n game
days (default 14) after the first news screen (RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS) and stops. The runs:
    normal   every option at its default, faster_days = off
    again    the same as normal: the runs are repeatable
    faster   faster_days = on: faster days changes no game decision
    silent   sound = off: sound changes no game decision
    off      every switch option off: no option changes a game decision
    sleep-off  RECOMP_IDLE_SLEEP=0: the idle sleep (#58) changes no game decision
    rules-on, rules-off  changing_rules (0.6.0 slice 11): a new game with it on has the season part
               bosman_season.dat in its save; from slice 17 it also plays by the rules table of 2001/02 (RULES_ON_PARTS). Every new-game run has
               changing_rules = off unless it sets it (new_game_runs), so the new game is the base game.
    kinds-base  RECOMP_SEASON_CHANGE_TEST=write (0.6.0 slice 16): a rule kind that writes the game in every
               hook changes nothing in the base game, because the base game calls no kind
Each run prints its count of idle sleeps (RECOMP_IDLE_COUNT=1). The check fails when the normal run
has none, here and in the match check.
Each save must be byte for byte the same as the save of "normal". A failed check names the parts of
the save file that differ. The runs play at the same time, about two minutes in all. A later option
that must not change the game adds a run to SAME_SAVE_RUNS.

With --save, each run loads that saved test game (tests/fixtures/fixtures.py) instead of a new game, then
takes the same Go on Holiday steps. The game is saved n game days after the load.

Search check (--same-save --save <name> --search): the runs open the player search and close it before
the holiday: search-off, search-on and search-on-again (full_player_search). Each save is compared with
the save of search-off.

Options box check (--same-save --save <name> --options): the runs open the Bosman Edition Options box from the
side bar before the holiday (0.5.0 slice 6). options and options-again switch Faster holidays off and on and
close the box. options-tabs clicks the tabs Game, Graphics and Game, options-rules switches the default of
Changing rules off and on (0.6.0 slice 13: the open game keeps its own value), and options-backups switches
Save backups off and on, so the box is built as often. Each save
must be the same as the save of options. The runs give the box the same save folder path end
(OPTIONS_USER_SUB).

Match check (--match): the same as the same-save check, but each run loads the saved test game
prematch.sav (tests/fixtures/fixtures.py) and plays the friendly at Basel on Friday 20.7.01 to the end.
The steps answer the Henry bid (Reject), go to the match, set the commentary speed to Very Fast and
kick off (--speed fastest: the Fastest step of #31 instead). At half time they restart the match. After the match, Continue Game and one
Space go on to Saturday 21.7.01 AM, where the runtime saves the game, 5 game days (default) after
the load. Later days are not reached: the Bergkamp rumour of 21.7.01 needs an answer. The runs are
in MATCH_RUNS and play at the same time, each in about two minutes. The mode is widescreen only,
because the match screens of the option match_columns draw only in widescreen.

The run uses a new empty save folder (RECOMP_USER_DIR is a temporary folder), so the game first shows its
settings. Before the start it writes settings.txt with the mode (default: classic). It saves five
screens. With --record it writes them to <reference folder>/<mode>. Without it, it compares them with
the reference pictures there. The reference pictures stay outside git, because they show the
original's screens.

With --database, settings.txt also chooses the data set of the new game, and the reference pictures are in
<reference folder>/<mode>-<data set>. The game folder must hold the data set folders (Data-3.9.60 and
Data-3.9.65, as in a download). Without it, the run uses the default 3.9.68 and <reference folder>/<mode>.

Widescreen mode draws at 1280x800 and the runtime scales every area by 1280/800 across and 800/600
down, so the run scales each click and the date box by the same factors.

Screens and checks:
    1 settings   the first-start settings screen: up to 20% of pixels differ (random background)
    2 setup      the Setup Game start screen: exact match
    3 leagues    Select League(s): exact match
    4 news       the first news screen of the new game, Saturday 14.7.01 AM: exact match
    5 holiday    30 s after "Go on Holiday": the date box differs from screen 4, so days passed

The runs use the SDL dummy audio driver: the sounds take their real time, without noise. A click ends
the intro and its sounds early, so the settings screen shows by 8 s.

The run sets Background Changes to Off on the settings screen, so screens 2 to 4 repeat. The days
pass on holiday, because Continue Game stops at random events (an offer for a player) that need an
answer. The news of the days is random, so screen 5 is only checked for a new date. In 30 s the
game passes about two weeks, with more than five days in every run so far.
