"""No "CD Not Required" box: a load and a new game go on without a click on Ok.

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/cd_box_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--dir <fixtures folder>]
        [--data-3965 <3.9.65 data set folder>]

The original shows the message box "CD Not Required" ("You may now remove the CM01/02 CD at any time")
at the end of a new game (call 0x82a98b in 0x828110) and of a load (call 0x82e400 in 0x82a9c0). The
build uses no CD, so the runtime skips the box at these two calls (cd_box in waits.c).

The runs play at the same time, with steps that never click Ok:
    load-classic     Restore Saved Game with start.sav (tests/fixtures/fixtures.py), to the first news screen
    load-widescreen  the same in widescreen
    new-game         Start New Game, England, Next, to the Enter Name screen
A run fails when a wait does not end (code 3; the box loop has no input poll, so the game stops there)
or when the log of the runtime does not name the skipped box.

The Italian runs play in the language Italian (game.cfg, see italian_cfg). There the title of the box is
"CD Non Richiesto". A player with any database other than 3.9.68 also saw the box "Database..cpp 7784" of
database_load_language_names 0x5339a0 at each load and new game (call 0x5358b7), because the .lng files fit the
3.9.68 data only. The runtime now writes the copied .lng files in the rows of a database that they do not fit, at
the data load of a new game (season_lng.c; tests/smoke/lng_fit_run.py tests it), so the box does not come. The runs
log each box that shows (RECOMP_SCREEN_LOG); any box and a skipped box 7784 fail the run, and so does a written
file in a run whose files fit, or no written file in the season run:
    load-italian         start.sav (3.9.68) in Italian, to the first news screen
    new-italian-3965     a new game on 3.9.65 in Italian, to the first news screen, then Save Game "Ita65"
    load-italian-3965    then a load of Ita65 in Italian, to the first news screen
    new-italian-season   a new game on the season database April 2022 (no .lng files of its own, other
                         counts) in Italian, to the Select Leagues screen
The season run copies <fixtures folder>/databases/April 2022 to Databases.
The 3.9.65 runs use a game folder of links to the given one, with Data-3.9.65 (--data-3965, by default
/Users/max/Projects/cm0102/data-3965). Their game.cfg comes from a first start in English.
