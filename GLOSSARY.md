# cm0102-mac

A native macOS port of Championship Manager 01/02, rebuilt from the original Windows program.

## Language

### Programs

**Original**:
The shipped Windows program, cm0102.exe. It is the reference for every behaviour.
_Avoid_: binary, the exe, the game

**Recompiled game**:
The original's code translated instruction by instruction into C, with a runtime that replaces the Windows calls. It is the program that every release ships.
_Avoid_: recomp, emulator, the port

**Hand port**:
The clean C program in this repo that rewrites parts of the original by hand and is checked against it by the differential test.
_Avoid_: port (alone), remake, clone, wrapper

### Distribution

**Bosman Edition**:
The product name, written in full as "CM 01/02: Bosman Edition", after the free transfers that older CM players know. It is an unofficial port of Championship Manager 01/02.
_Avoid_: Championship Manager (as the product name), Re-Signed Edition (the old name), CM Modern Edition

**Free release**:
The CD image that Eidos made free to download in 2008. It holds version 3.9.60 of the original and its data.
_Avoid_: freeware, ISO, base game

**Official patch**:
The 3.9.68 update from Sports Interactive, the last official update. It changes the original and its data.
_Avoid_: latest patch, update

**Clean files**:
The free release with the official patch applied, and nothing else. They are the only input to a release. The 3.9.60 data set comes from the same free release.
_Avoid_: vanilla, original files

**Fan pack**:
A community collection that adds a loader, patches or updated data to the game. It is never an input to a release.
_Avoid_: mod pack, starter kit

**Release**:
One numbered version of the Bosman Edition, published with a tag and the downloads for Mac and Windows.
_Avoid_: build, drop

**Download**:
The file that a player gets from a release: the recompiled game with the clean files, ready to start.
_Avoid_: package, installer, bundle

### Display

**Widescreen mode**:
The game drawn at 1280x800. It is the default.
_Avoid_: wide mode

**HD mode**:
The game drawn at 1920x1080, in 0.4.0 to 0.5.0 only (`display = hd`). Removed after 0.5.0 (Max, 2026-10-16, Q267): widescreen looks better on large screens. An old `display = hd` gives widescreen.
_Avoid_: larger text, 4K mode

**Classic mode**:
The game drawn at 800x600, as the original draws it.
_Avoid_: 4:3 mode, original mode

**Sharp bilinear**:
The scaling of `sharp_picture = on` from 0.6.0. The game draws its picture with nearest pixels at a whole number of times its size, then scales that to the window with linear filtering. Letters keep an even shape at every window size.
_Avoid_: whole pixels, integer scaling

**Display report**:
The file display-report.txt in the save folder, from 0.6.0. It lists the system, the screens and their scale, the window and how the game scales its picture, and the last 10 window changes. The game writes it at start and at quit. Ctrl+Shift+D (Cmd+Shift+D on a Mac) writes it again and copies it to the clipboard. Players add it to reports of picture and window problems.
_Avoid_: diagnostics, debug log, system info

### Screen

**Screen manager**:
The single object that owns every area and widget on the current screen and draws them in order. The original keeps it in display.cpp.
_Avoid_: scrman, display, UI manager

The list of screens that a player has open, with the newest on top. Each screen names the functions that build it, handle its input and close it. The original keeps it in scrman.cpp.
_Avoid_: scrman, screen history

**Area**:
A rectangular region of the screen, split into a grid of columns and rows. An area can scroll its rows.
_Avoid_: window, pane, region

**Widget**:
One control on the screen, such as a text cell, a button or a picture. A widget sits in a grid cell of an area or stands free.
_Avoid_: control, cell

**Popup area**:
An area that belongs to a widget and opens next to it.
_Avoid_: dropdown, menu

**Panel**:
The background and border of an area or widget.
_Avoid_: frame, box

**Glyph table**:
A small one-colour picture, such as a scroll arrow, stored as one byte per pixel.
_Avoid_: icon, sprite

### Text

**Bitmap font**:
One of the seven fonts that the original loads from its .fnt files and uses when its font setting is -1.
_Avoid_: raster font, FNT font

**Glyph**:
The picture of one character in a bitmap font.
_Avoid_: character image, letter

**Mark**:
A small picture that a widget draws beside its text: the tick or one of the three arrows.

**Text entry**:
A widget that takes typed text, such as the first name of the manager. A click, Tab or Enter starts or ends the editing.

The option `database` names it. A download holds 3.9.60 and 3.9.65 in the folders Data-3.9.60 and Data-3.9.65 of the game folder.
_Avoid_: database version, data pack, DB

**Progress bar**:
The box that shows how far a long step has gone, such as "Loading database".

_Avoid_: year (for the whole season), edition

**Season game**:

_Avoid_: modern game, new-season game

_Avoid_: season pack, database zips

**Extra database**:
An Update Team database that is not a season database, such as an April or SIM version. The Choose Season screen does not offer them (Q417).
_Avoid_: more versions, alternative database

**Custom database**:
A database folder that the player adds and that is not a known Update Team database. The player names its season.

**Bench**:
The named substitutes of a match. The rules table column `bench` holds the count. The match engine holds at most 9.
_Avoid_: reserves, subs list

**Substitutes used**:
The substitutes a team may bring on in a match. The rules table column `subs_used` holds the count.
_Avoid_: changes, swaps

**Transfer window**:
